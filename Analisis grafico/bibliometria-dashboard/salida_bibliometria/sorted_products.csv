This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial.

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.",Forging; Preform design; Generative artificial intelligence,1526-6125,144.0,,190,208,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.",Generative artificial intelligence; Copyright infringement; Original work sharing platform; Crowding out; Protective motivation theory,0167-9236,197.0,,114513,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties.

Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models.

A study on international scientific journal cover design driven by generative artificial intelligence,"Gao, Zhan; Li, Zhenyu",2025,2025/12/01/,Displays,10.1016/j.displa.2025.103141,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938225001787,"The application of generative artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual design is increasingly widespread, particularly showing significant potential in scientific publications. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.",Scientific journal cover design; Artificial intelligence; Midjourney; Stable diffusion; Deepseek; VIKOR,0141-9382,90.0,,103141,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

Adoption of generative artificial intelligence in management education using unlearning mechanism,"Sharma, Shubham",2025,2025/12/01/,The International Journal of Management Education,10.1016/j.ijme.2025.101249,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811725001193,"The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.",Unlearning; Generative artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Resistance to change; Management education,1472-8117,23.0,3,101249,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research.

Assessing the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents by means of generative artificial intelligence,"Herzberg, Andre",2025,2025/06/01/,World Patent Information,10.1016/j.wpi.2025.102363,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0172219025000304,"In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies.",,0172-2190,81.0,,102363,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices.",Generative artificial intelligence; Critical language awareness; English as an additional language; Writing education; Critical AI literacy; Digital literacies,0346-251X,134.0,,103806,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products.

GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and ""human–AI teaming"" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment.

Accurate thermodynamic modeling is essential for reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Existing GT performance modeling methods have relatively poor generalization and adaptability under different operating conditions and different units. This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5% and 0.54%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management.

However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field.

During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary.

The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug). The respondents' academic disciplines influenced their perceptions of GenAI, but overall, the results suggest that most viewed it as transformative, i.e., more than just a writing tool.

Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide.

Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews.

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.",Generative artificial intelligence; Social cognition; Theory of mind; Emotion recognition; Multimodal assessment; Generative artificial intelligence and mental health,2451-9588,19.0,,100702,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

A systematic literature review on designing self-regulated learning using generative artificial intelligence and its future research directions,"Xia, Qi; Liu, Qian; Tlili, Ahmed; Chiu, Thomas K.F.",2026,2026/01/01/,Computers & Education,10.1016/j.compedu.2025.105465,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131525002337,"A growing body of research suggests that generative AI (GenAI) can significantly enhance self-regulated learning (SRL) through its immediacy and interactivity. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms by which generative AI influences SRL, as well as the difficulties teachers encounter when trying to incorporate it into their classrooms. This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools.",Generative artificial intelligence; Self-regulated learning; Forethought; Performance; Self-reflection; Systematic review,0360-1315,240.0,,105465,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris

The double-edged impact of generative artificial intelligence dependence on service innovation in the hospitality industry: A self-regulation perspective,"Zhang, Zhenduo; Dai, Yanyu; Guo, Jianing; Zhang, Haonan; Shen, Yifei; Xiao, Huan",2026,2026/01/01/,International Journal of Hospitality Management,10.1016/j.ijhm.2025.104392,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431925003202,"To date, studies on the relationship between generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) dependence and service innovation have yielded inconsistent results. Drawing on self-regulation theory, we examine how and when GenAI dependence promotes or inhibits service innovation in the hospitality industry. Three studies were conducted to examine how GenAI is used in hospitality management and test the conceptual model: a three-wave questionnaire survey (N = 333), a quasi-field experiment (N = 227), and an in-depth interview (N = 11). The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism. Meanwhile, GenAI dependence inhibits service innovation by decreasing problem-solving pondering, and this unfavourable indirect path is weakened by employees’ conscientiousness. This exploration of when and how the use of GenAI either promotes or inhibits service innovation broadens our understanding of the consequences of GenAI dependence in the hospitality management field.",Generative artificial intelligence dependence; Problem-solving pondering; Affective rumination; Service innovation; Conscientiousness; Neuroticism,0278-4319,132.0,,104392,,ScienceDirect,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250928_1121.ris; /home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250928_1121.ris
