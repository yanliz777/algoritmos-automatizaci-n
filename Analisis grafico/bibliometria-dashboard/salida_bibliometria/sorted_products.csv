More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist.

VR technology faces a number of ethical issues, including a reduction of users’ autonomy, health problems, and privacy concerns. The use of VR and realism in education can turn out to be a double-edged sword. While realistic visualizations can promote learning for some content domains, they can hinder comprehension in others. Furthermore, the effects of realism on learning also depend on learners’ spatial abilities. Letting young children and teenagers engage in virtual educational experiences can expose them to manipulation, could lead to health issues, and may infringe on their privacy. In short, realism and virtual experiences may severely limit learners’ autonomy in a number of ways. Based on a review of the literature and considerations of emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence, this paper presents guidelines for the ethically sound utilization of VR and realism. By applying findings and conclusions established in the context of research on the ethics of VR to the educational utilization of this technology, I develop several suggestions that may help to avoid negative consequences of educational VR. These suggestions include the utilization of spatial ability testing, requiring virtual experiences to offer alternative paths to prevent manipulation, as well as using algorithms that deidentify the highly detailed developmental profiles that can be generated through educational VR use.",Virtual reality; Education; Ethics; Realism; Autonomy; Privacy,2949-6780,2.0,,100023,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”).",Academic integrity; Bard; ChatGPT; Critical analysis; DALL-E; Ethics; Future of education; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Google; Education; Educator; Management education; Management educator; OpenAI; Paradox; Paradox theory; Ragnarök; Reformation; Transformation; Transformative education,1472-8117,21.0,2,100790,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p7_20250929_0703.ris

Concerns have largely been associated with academic integrity, cheating and plagiarism. HEIs have had to develop guidelines in response to GAI. As many of these guidelines were developed in haste and could affect a large number of instructors and students, there is a need to examine their content, coverage and suitability. This review examines the extent to which the world's 50 top-ranking HEIs have developed or modified their assessment guidelines to address GAI use and, where guidelines exist, the primary content and advice given to guide instructors in their GAI assessment design and practices. The findings show that just under half of the institutions have developed publicly available guidelines. The guidelines cover three main areas: academic integrity, advice on assessment design and communicating with students. Amongst the suggestions for teachers on assessment design, two appear particularly pertinent in helping develop effective assessment tasks and developing learners’ AI literacy: first, running assessment tasks through GAI to check the extent to which the tool can accomplish the task and, second, having students use GAI as part of the assessment process. Overall, the review suggests that HEIs have come to accept the use of GAI and drafted assessment guidelines to advise instructors on its use. In the article, we argue that it may be beneficial to embrace GAI as a part of the assessment process since this is the reality of today's educational and job landscape. This will require instructors to develop a new competence - generative artificial intelligence assessment literacy - which is conceptualised in this article.",Generative artificial intelligence; Assessment guidelines; Higher education; ChatGPT; Academic integrity,2666-5573,5.0,,100151,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

We employed two different generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies: CTAB-GAN+ and Normalizing Flows (NFlow) to synthesize clinical trial data based on pooled patient data from four previous multicenter clinical trials of the German Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, AML2003, AML60+, SORAML) that enrolled adult patients (n=1606) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive induction therapy. As a generative adversarial network (GAN), CTAB-GAN+ consists of two adversarial networks: a generator producing synthetic samples from random noise and a discriminator aiming to distinguish between real and synthetic samples. The model converges as the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real or synthetic data. Contrastingly, NFlow consists of a sequence of invertible transformations (flows) starting from a simple base distribution and gradually adding complexity to better mirror the training data. Both models were trained on tabular data including demographic, laboratory, molecular genetic and cytogenetic patient variables. Detection of molecular alterations in the original cohort was performed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 5% variant-allele frequency (VAF) mutation calling cut-off. For cytogenetics, standard techniques for chromosome banding and fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) were used. Hyperparameter tuning of generative models was conducted using the Optuna Framework. For each model, we used a total of 70 optimization trials to optimize a custom score inspired by TabSynDex which assesses both the resemblance of the synthetic data to real training data and its utility. Pairwise analyses were conducted between the original and both synthetic data sets, respectively. All tests were carried out as two-sided tests using a significance level α of 0.05. Table 1 summarizes baseline patient characteristics and outcome for both synthetic cohorts compared to the original cohort. Firstly, we found both models to adequately represent patient features, albeit that some individual variables showed a statistically significant deviation from the original cohort. It is important to note that for such a large sample size (n=1606 for each cohort), even miniscule differences can be rendered statistically significant notwithstanding any meaningful clinical difference. Interestingly, variables that deviated from the original distribution were different for both models indicating model architecture to play a vital role in sample representation: While CTAB-GAN+ showed significant deviations for both age and sex, NFlow showed significant deviations for AML status. Complete remission rate was similar between original (70.7%, odds ratio [OR]: 2.41) and CTAB-GAN+ (73.7%, OR: 2.81, p=0.059) and NFlow (69.1%, OR: 2.24, p=0.356). For event-free survival (EFS), which was not included as a target in hyperparameter tuning, both networks deviated significantly from the original cohort (original: median 7.2 months, HR: 1.36; CTAB-GAN+: median 12.8 months, HR 0.74, p<0.001; NFlow: median 9.0 months, HR: 0.87, p=0.001). Overall survival (OS) was well represented by NFlow compared to the original cohort, while CTAB-GAN+ showed a significant deviation (original: median 17.5 months, HR: 1.14; CTAB-GAN+: median 19.5 months, HR 0.88, p<0.001; NFlow: median 16.2 months, HR: 1.00, p=0.055). Both models showed an adequate graph representation in Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 1). Here, we demonstrate using two different generative AI technologies that synthetic data generation provides an attractive solution to circumvent issues in current standards of data collection and sharing. It effectively allows for bypassing logistical, organizational, and financial burdens, as well as regulatory and ethical concerns. Ultimately, this enables explorative research inquiries into previously inaccessible data sets and offers the prospect of fully synthetic control arms in prospective clinical trials.",,0006-4971,142.0,,2268,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

Revolutionizing Digital Pathology With the Power of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Foundation Models,"Waqas, Asim; Bui, Marilyn M.; Glassy, Eric F.; El Naqa, Issam; Borkowski, Piotr; Borkowski, Andrew A.; Rasool, Ghulam",2023,2023/11/01/,Laboratory Investigation,10.1016/j.labinv.2023.100255,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023683723001988,"Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workflow. Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many image-processing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can self-correct mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathology-specific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis.

This paper introduces a deep learning approach that combines Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and explicitly leverages physiological indicators to enhance the model's intelligence, versatility, and automation. Physiological indicators such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) can be measured using sensors placed on the body's surface, providing more precise information about human emotional changes. This research employs a three-dimensional emotion model, including the tension-arousal axis, energy-arousal axis, and valence axis, to explain the correlation and accuracy between music data and emotions. Based on this, a music emotion classifier is designed, incorporating GAI algorithms to recommend music by matching users' physiological and emotional types with the emotional features of music. The classifier uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to transform audio into Mel-spectrogram as input features. The music emotion selection module adopts a GAI framework of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and integrates multi-scale parallel convolution and attention mechanism modules. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is competitive compared to existing deep learning architectures on PMEmo, RAVDESS, and Soundtrack datasets. Furthermore, due to GAI's efficient classification capability, this model is suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices and other smart devices.

It is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use. In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees’ jobs more fulfilling — managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.",Artificial intelligence; Generative artificial intelligence; Innovation management; Innovation process,0166-4972,136.0,,103081,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

Background: Despite the numerous benefits to including OEQs in assessment of medical knowledge1,2, only 39% of US allopathic medical schools use them3. Faculty report that the biggest barrier is the time it takes to grade student responses1,2. Natural language processing has been explored to automate scoring of clinical reasoning4, but no study has evaluated the use of generative AI to score OEQ responses in the pre-clerkship curriculum. Methods: OEQ responses from two questions administered at the Zucker School of Medicine (ZSOM) and the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF) were used for the current study5. Responses from 54 students per site were analyzed. Content experts scored the responses using an analytic (ZSOM) or holistic rubric (UCSF). Questions, rubrics, and student responses were fed into the GPT-4 model via the Med2Lab platform. Once finalized, scores for each student’s response were generated. Cohen’s weighted kappa (kw) was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the content expert and generative AI scores, with kw scores between 0.60 and 0.80 being considered substantial6. Prompt engineering was employed for question 1 (analytic rubric) to evaluate its impact on IRR. Results: IRR between the content expert and generative AI scores was substantial using the analytic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.71; question 2: kw = 0.63) and the holistic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.66; question 2: kw = 0.68). IRR for question 1 (analytic rubric) was initially kw = 0.61 but was increased to kw = 0.71 after adjustments with prompt engineering and re-run in GPT-4. Conclusions: Generative AI can score OEQs with substantial reliability.

Co-creating art with generative artificial intelligence: Implications for artworks and artists,"Messer, Uwe",2024,2024/01/01/,Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans,10.1016/j.chbah.2024.100056,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882124000161,"Synthetic visual art is becoming a commodity due to generative artificial intelligence (AI). The trend of using AI for co-creation will not spare artists’ creative processes, and it is important to understand how the use of generative AI at different stages of the creative process affects both the evaluation of the artist and the result of the human-machine collaboration (i.e., the visual artifact). In three experiments (N = 560), this research explores how the evaluation of artworks is transformed by the revelation that the artist collaborated with AI at different stages of the creative process. The results show that co-created art is less liked and recognized, especially when AI was used in the implementation stage. While co-created art is perceived as more novel, it lacks creative authenticity, which exerts a dominant influence. The results also show that artists’ perceptions suffer from the co-creation process, and that artists who co-create are less admired because they are perceived as less authentic. Two boundary conditions are identified. The negative effect can be mitigated by disclosing the level of artist involvement in co-creation with AI (e.g., by training the algorithm on a curated set of images vs. simply prompting an off-the-shelf AI image generator). In the context of art that is perceived as commercially motivated (e.g., stock images), the effect is also diminished.

Prior quantitative geography studies have mostly emphasized human visual perceptions, neglecting human auditory perceptions at place due to the challenges in characterizing the acoustic environment vividly. Also, few studies have synthesized the two-dimensional (auditory and visual) perceptions in understanding human sense of place. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to visualize soundscapes through the generation of street view images. By creating audio-image pairs, acoustic environments are first represented as high-dimensional semantic audio vectors. Our proposed Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, which contains a Low-Resolution Diffusion Model and a Super-Resolution Diffusion Model, can then translate those semantic audio vectors into visual representations of place effectively. We evaluated our proposed model by using both machine-based and human-centered approaches. We proved that the generated street view images align with our common perceptions, and accurately create several key street elements of the original soundscapes. It also demonstrates that soundscapes provide sufficient visual information places. This study stands at the forefront of the intersection between generative AI and human geography, demonstrating how human multi-sensory experiences can be linked. We aim to enrich geospatial data science and AI studies with human experiences.

Generative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a large data set to create something in the genre of that data set. It can generate different outputs ranging from texts, audio, objects, pictures, and paintings to videos, but also synthetic data. LLMs use deep learning and deep neural networks to train on large text corpora for recognizing and generating texts. These models are based on massive data sets, collected from databases and the web. They use transformer models to detect how elements in sequences relate to each other. This provides context support.

In some countries, including the United States and Sweden, access is advanced with patients obtaining rapid access to their full records on the web including laboratory and test results, lists of prescribed medications, vaccinations, and even the very narrative reports written by clinicians (the latter, commonly referred to as “open notes”). In the United States, patient’s ORA is also available in a downloadable form for use with other apps. While survey studies have shown that some patients report many benefits from ORA, there remain challenges with implementation around writing clinical documentation that patients may now read. With ORA, the functionality of the record is evolving; it is no longer only an aide memoire for doctors but also a communication tool for patients. Studies suggest that clinicians are changing how they write documentation, inviting worries about accuracy and completeness. Other concerns include work burdens; while few objective studies have examined the impact of ORA on workload, some research suggests that clinicians are spending more time writing notes and answering queries related to patients’ records. Aimed at addressing some of these concerns, clinician and patient education strategies have been proposed. In this viewpoint paper, we explore these approaches and suggest another longer-term strategy: the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinicians in documenting narrative summaries that patients will find easier to understand. Applied to narrative clinical documentation, we suggest that such approaches may significantly help preserve the accuracy of notes, strengthen writing clarity and signals of empathy and patient-centered care, and serve as a buffer against documentation work burdens. However, we also consider the current risks associated with existing generative AI. We emphasize that for this innovation to play a key role in ORA, the cocreation of clinical notes will be imperative. We also caution that clinicians will need to be supported in how to work alongside generative AI to optimize its considerable potential.",ChatGPT; generative language models; large language models; medical education; Open Notes; online record access; patient-centered care; empathy; language model; documentation; communication tool; clinical documentation,2369-3762,10.0,,,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

Equipment in industrial scenarios often operates in normal conditions, resulting in missing anomalies, limited failures, and incomplete degradation paths. Thus the limited information on the state of the equipment collected from sensor readings severely hinders the cognitive capabilities of discriminative artificial intelligence (AI) for PHM. Data augmentation and generation (DA&G) techniques, represented by generative AI, have shown great promise in overcoming the limitations of PHM application scenarios. Research on DA&G has yielded significant achievements, but a comprehensive review in the mechanical field is still lacking. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA&G techniques aimed at solving the DDP problems, which are divided into three categories insights of data, mechanism, and features. The data-based randomized approach applies controlled randomness for augmentation. The mechanism-based domain-specific techniques advocate for exploring relationships between the physical entity and monitoring data for generating by reasoned inference.

Unlike traditional ML models that predict based on existing data, this framework innovatively generates new concrete mix designs that meet specific requirements such as strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced embodied CO2. To propose a powerful and reliable generative AI model, several advanced ML algorithms were considered, e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, and LGBM. These models were trained on a unique dataset consisting of 4,936 data points collected from five different batching plants and have not been published yet. Bayesian Optimisation was employed to fine-tune model hyperparameters, resulting in the most effective models attaining R2 values of 0.94 and 0.89 for raw and grouped data, respectively. To verify the trained generative AI model, a case study was conducted, in which the model was requested to provide designs of a mix with pre-determined strength and optimised cost and embodied CO2. The mix designs generated by the framework were successfully validated through experimental tests, corroborating the predictive outcomes.

However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them.

This study adopted a quantitative methodology for the data collection process applying a cross-sectional approach through testing deductive-hypotheses techniques. 263 valid surveys were used for analysis using hybrid analysis measurements (i.e., PLS-SEM, and CB-SEM). Further, it was applied data reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity tests. Additionally, examined the mediating effect of exploratory innovation (EXPI), and exploitative innovation (EXTI) on DSCP. The study findings assured that the proposed direct and indirect causal associations illustrated in the study model were accepted due to that all associations between the dimensions s were statistically significant.

While scholars argue that integrating GenAI tools can enhance productivity, critics raise concerns about the negative effect of such integration on critical thinking (CrT). This study therefore proposed a framework for enhancing students’ CrT skills in synthesizing AI-generated information. The proposed framework is underpinned by various theoretical foundations, encompassing five interconnected step-wise phases (familiarizing, conceptualizing, inquiring, evaluating, and synthesizing). The study was conducted under two separate experiments. The first experiment (Study 1) validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework, providing CrT training to 179 postgraduate students. In the second study (n = 125), additional experiments were undertaken to confirm the effectiveness of the framework in different contexts. An experimental procedure involving pretest and posttest design was implemented wherein participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: experimental group 1 (exposed to our framework), experimental group 2 (exposed to an alternative self-regulated learning framework), and a control group (exposed to a non-structured framework). Results from Study 1 revealed that the framework enhances students’ CrT skills to synthesize AI-generated texts. However, these CrT skills manifested through various rigorous training aimed at reinforcing learning. While the proposed framework holds considerable value in cultivating CrT skills, significant differences arise across various personality traits. In Study 2, the framework proved to be effective in different contexts.

This study investigated the impact of GAI chatbots on elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking skills, focusing on two interaction configurations—individual and paired. Eighty-five elementary school EFL learners participated in a three-week summer program, engaging in daily 45-min interactions with CoolE Bot. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) individual interaction with CoolE Bot (I-Bot group), (2) paired interaction with CoolE Bot (P-Bot group), and (3) interaction with teachers and peers in a conventional English classroom (No-Bot group). In each class, participants in the Bot group received worksheets with a topic, prompts, and vocabulary to guide their interactions with CoolE Bot, while those in the No-Bot group also received worksheets for comparable activities. Quantitative (English-speaking tests) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the I-Bot and P-Bot groups' post-test speaking skills were significantly higher than those of the No-Bot group. CoolE Bot significantly improved the speaking skills of EFL learners.

The results show that under a single load value target condition of the designed structure, the minimum deviation index (R2) between the load value corresponding to the displacement point and the target load value is only 0.987, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 5.92 %.

A significant portion of the current use of LLMs by educators has involved using conversational user interfaces (CUIs), such as chat windows, for functions like generating educational materials or offering feedback to learners. The ability to engage in real-time conversations with LLMs, which can enhance educators' domain knowledge across various subjects, has been of high value. However, it also presents challenges to LLMs' widespread, ethical, and effective adoption. Firstly, educators must have a degree of expertise, including tool familiarity, AI literacy and prompting to effectively use CUIs, which can be a barrier to adoption. Secondly, the open-ended design of CUIs makes them exceptionally powerful, which raises ethical concerns, particularly when used for high-stakes decisions like grading. Additionally, there are risks related to privacy and intellectual property, stemming from the potential unauthorised sharing of sensitive information. Finally, CUIs are designed for short, synchronous interactions and often struggle and hallucinate when given complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., providing individual feedback based on a rubric on a large scale). To address these challenges, we explored the benefits of transitioning away from employing LLMs via CUIs to the creation of applications with user-friendly interfaces that leverage LLMs through API calls.

This paper introduces a paradigm shift in collaborative production systems by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs). Contrary to traditional methods that rely on pre-defined assembly instructions, this paper introduces a novel framework employing primitive knowledge of the production process, including product design and required assembly steps. By integrating LLMs and a behavior tree-based system control, this approach enables programmers to rapidly deploy collaborative assembly procedures by expediting the programming of robotic operations. The system also incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which facilitate real-time alterations in assembly steps, leading to reduced overall production time. The framework’s behavior tree-based control architecture allows for dynamic adaptability, offering optimized solutions across a range of assembly scenarios. The results of the framework’s deployment suggest that this innovative programming paradigm significantly enhances both the adaptability and efficiency of collaborative manufacturing settings.",Generative AI; Human Robot collaboration; Design informatics,2212-8271,128.0,,621,626,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

Leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence in Diagnosis of Thrombotic Microangiopathies: Focus on Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,"Choi, Eunhee; Lee, Jung-Hyun; McDougal, Robert; Lytton, William W",2024,2024/11/05/,66th ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts,10.1182/blood-2024-194769,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497124053692,"Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), with etiologies ranging from benign to life-threatening, necessitates rapid and accurate diagnosis, particularly for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), to initiate timely plasmapheresis preventing severe outcomes. Diagnosing TTP is challenging due to overlapping clinical features with other causes of TMA, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), compounded by that specific diagnostic tests such as biopsies or ADAMTS13 activity assays do not result immediately. This study explored GPT-4's capability in suggesting differential diagnoses for TMA patients and identifying a provisional diagnosis of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup to determine the need for prompt plasmapheresis, assessing its potential as a diagnostic support tool. Method We utilized open-access case reports from PubMed Central that provided a comprehensive list of cases with diagnosis of TMA. The exclusion criteria included cases with no access, copyright permission issues, preprints, insufficient description, non-case reports, non-English language, and no established diagnosis for TMA. Each case input including only the history and physical examination (H&P) and basic diagnostic workup excluding the confirmatory diagnosis was presented to GPT-4 in three separate trials and was prompted to provide clinical reasoning that both favored or rejected the diagnosis of TTP, create a top three differential diagnoses list selected from a comprehensive list of TMA diagnoses, and determine the necessity of plasmapheresis. Generated results were subsequently compared with the confirmed case diagnosis and management provided within the case report. Result An initial PubMed Central search identified 424 cases; 326 were excluded, resulting in 98 eligible cases. The top three differential diagnoses generated for each case in all three trials exhibited relatively higher F1-scores for ITP, TTP, HUS, and HELLP syndrome, with values of 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, and 0.7, respectively. Other causes of TMA scored below 0.5. Overall performance metrics indicated a specificity of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.80, precision of 0.28, and an F1-score of 0.42. When grouped into TTP versus non-TTP cases, the sensitivity was notably high at 0.98, showing that GPT-4 could adequately rule out TTP, although the specificity was 0.76. When comparing the case diagnosis with the primary diagnosis within the top three differential diagnoses, the overall specificity was 0.96, sensitivity was 0.56, precision was 0.58, and the F1-score was 0.57. The match rate of GPT-4 suggesting plasmapheresis compared to the case report was 76%. In cases confirmed as TTP, GPT-4 demonstrated 100% accuracy in recommending plasmapheresis. For non-TTP cases, GPT-4 showed a 66% match rate compared to the case report's decision to initiate plasmapheresis, indicating a 34% reduction in suggesting plasmapheresis for these cases. Error analysis revealed that errors were primarily due to GPT-4 ignoring pertinent findings, inaccurate knowledge, and confounding symptoms or findings within the case report itself. Discussion This study demonstrated that GPT-4 could adequately assist in the diagnosis of TMA and provide suggestions for early management of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup. GPT-4 appropriately recommended plasmapheresis for TTP cases and showed a comparable performance of that of a clinically commonly used tool in these settings, PLASMIC score. However, in our study, GPT-4 made errors such as ignoring pertinent findings and demonstrating incomplete knowledge, highlighting the need for pretraining and areas to improve regarding diagnosis of TMA. The study suggested that GPT-4 could be integrated as a diagnostic support tool, especially for complex, time-sensitive conditions, while emphasizing that it should complement, not replace, clinical judgment.",,0006-4971,144.0,,2616,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

Here, we report an invertebrate trace fossil association from the largest and best-exposed Permian (Cisuralian) supervolcano in Europe, the Bolzano Supervolcano. The fossil association is dominated by abundant trace fossils that are unusually straight, i.e., their curvature is zero along the entire preserved length. The trace fossils are attributed to Planolites and Palaeophycus and they form a bioturbated texture (ichnofabric) with a characteristically high bioturbation intensity (percent bioturbated>90%). U-shaped (Arenicolites) and concentrically-lined (Cylindrichnus) burrows are minor components of the ichnofabric. The characteristics of the trace fossil association suggest substrate colonization by r-strategic organisms during periods of minor volcanic activity. In these periods of stasis, the volcanic rocks were eroded by seasonal streams, which provided suitable softground substrates for the infauna. Insects are regarded as the most plausible tracemakers of the straight burrows. Similar ichnofabrics are found in other continental volcanoclastic sites, suggesting that ichnofabrics dominated by straight burrows may represent an ichnological proxy of brief windows for colonization in volcanically influenced freshwater environments. Generative artificial intelligence has been used to graphically reconstitute the tiering pattern and the palaeoenvironment.

By doing so, the performance and generalizability of these techniques often rely on the quality and quantity of the available training data. However, gathering a diverse training dataset that captures multiple nuances of students’ reasoning poses challenges in educational settings due to resource constraints. We compared three data augmentation strategies to address this issue: collecting additional student data, utilizing chatbots to paraphrase existing responses, and prompting chatbots to generate synthetic responses. We found that leveraging data augmentation significantly improved ML model performance. In detail, combining authentic and/or paraphrased responses with chatbot responses yielded the best machine-human score agreements across various validation conditions. This data augmentation allowed us to expand our applied scoring rubric by introducing a more detailed categorization that better captured the level of causality in undergraduate chemistry students’ reasoning about reaction mechanisms. Together, these findings highlight effective possibilities for augmenting the size and heterogeneity of the training data to improve ML model performance and generalizability, introduce a more fine-grained categorization, and reduce human effort in data collection.

This study investigates the perceived effectiveness of concept explanations produced by GAI compared to those created by human teachers, focusing on programming concepts of sequence, selection, and iteration. The research also explores teachers' and students' ability to discern the source of these explanations. Participants included 11 teachers and 70 sixth-grade students who were presented with concept explanations created or generated by teachers and ChatGPT. They were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and identify their source. Results indicated that teachers found GAI-generated explanations more helpful for sequence and selection concepts, while preferring teacher-created explanations for iteration (χ2(2, N = 11) = 10.062, p = .007, ω = .595). In contrast, students showed varying abilities to distinguish between AI-generated and teacher-created explanations across concepts, with significant differences observed (χ2(2, N = 70) = 22.127, p < .001, ω = .399). Notably, students demonstrated difficulty in identifying the source of explanations for the iteration concept (χ2(1, N = 70) = 8.45, p = .004, φ = .348). Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed that teachers and students employed similar criteria for evaluating explanations but differed in their ability to discern the source. Teachers focused on pedagogical effectiveness, while students prioritized relatability and clarity. The findings highlight the importance of considering both teachers' and students' perspectives when integrating GAI into computer science education.

We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships?

Drawing on John Maynard Keynes’s projections of technological unemployment and the evolving nature of work, it argues that despite advancements in automation, work has not diminished but rather devalued. Design, understood as a type of knowledge work, faces an apparent existential crisis. GenAI grows adept at mimicking the output of creative processes. The article explores how the fear of the end of design work fueled by the rise of GenAI is rooted in a misunderstanding of design work. This misunderstanding is driven by managerialism—an ideology that prioritizes efficiency and quantifiable outcomes over the intrinsic value of work. Managerialism seeks to instrumentalize and automate design, turning it into a controllable procedure to generate quantifiable creative outputs. The article argues why design work cannot be turned into a procedure and automated using GenAI. Advocates of these systems claim they enhance productivity and open new opportunities. However, evidence so far shows that flawed GenAI models produce disappointing outcomes while operating at a significant environmental cost.

Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Development of Plain Language Summaries: A Blinded Assessment of Education Preferences of the Sickle Cell Disease Community,"Shastri, Oliver; Agrippa, Orlando; Moss, Valerie; Millard, Eleanor; More, Lianne; Brown, Eleanor Rose; Sharif, Seraj; Finch, Chris",2024,2024/11/05/,66th ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts,10.1182/blood-2024-206965,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497124104934,"Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited condition that reduces life expectancy and has a profound impact on quality of life. Assessment of social media conversations in the SCD community in the UK highlighted health inequities, including issues with access to emergency care, low levels of healthcare professional empathy, and racial bias/stigmatization (Shastri O, et al. ASH 2023; abstract 1057). This emphasizes the urgent unmet need for additional education. Use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the development of medical content, including plain language summaries (PLS) of research may increase efficiency, reduce resource cost and ultimately improve accessibility to educational information across a range of audiences. We assessed the ability of GenAI to develop a PLS of our social media listening study. Methods: We developed 3 written versions of a PLS of this study: human-written by a medical writer, AI-generated, and hybrid AI-human, where a person living with SCD edited the AI version for readability. Each was ~300-400 words and with a target reading age of 12 years. The AI PLS was developed using Pfizer's GenAI tool, MAIA (Medical AI assistant). A video version of each written PLS was developed using the AI tool, Synthesia. People with SCD and their carers (≥18 years of age) were recruited via telephone to complete an online survey to assess the understandability of the 3 written PLS and preference for written versus video PLS. Participants were presented with 1 of the 3 written PLS at random and asked to assess how easily they understood it on a 5-point scale (1=very difficult; 2=difficult; 3=neither difficult nor easy; 4=easy; 5=very easy). They were then asked 3 multiple-choice questions to gauge their understanding. Participants then rated the other 2 written PLS and were asked to rank all 3 in order of most easily understood. Finally, participants watched the video version of their top-rated written PLS and stated which format they preferred. Participants were blinded to PLS source. The Flesch-Kincaid calculator (https://goodcalculators.com/flesch-kincaid-calculator/) was used to provide an objective measure of readability for each PLS. Results: Of 93 participants, there were 88 living with SCD and 5 caring for someone with SCD. The AI versions of the PLS achieved similar scores for understandability to the human-written version: mean ± standard deviation understandability scores were 4.1 ± 0.9 (human), 4.0 ± 0.9 (AI), and 3.9 ± 0.8 (AI-hybrid). Overall, 81% of participants identified the human PLS as easy or very easy to read, similar to 76% for the AI PLS, and 74% for the AI-hybrid PLS. Overall, 41 participants (44%) ranked the human PLS in first place for understandability, 31 (33%) the AI PLS, and 21 (23%) the AI-hybrid PLS. For the multiple-choice questions, results were similar regardless of which PLS participants saw first, with over 85% correctly identifying the main findings of the study and the conclusions of the author; however, 63% incorrectly thought the data on which the PLS was based were obtained from interviewing people affected by SCD rather than social media listening. Fifty-four participants (58%) preferred the video PLS over the written PLS, 27 participants (29%) preferred the written PLS and 12 (13%) had no preference. Flesch-Kincaid scores for the three PLS were as follows: human (reading ease score, 62; reading level, 8th to 9th grade); AI (reading ease score, 58; reading level, 10th to 12th grade); AI-hybrid (reading ease score, 63; reading level, 8th to 9th grade). Conclusion: There is a clear need for additional resources and education in SCD, which may be supported by the development of PLS. The limited studies that have assessed the capabilities of AI to generate PLS to date have focussed on clinical research. We have now expanded this to assess use of AI to develop PLS from a social media listening study that evaluated real-world experiences of the UK SCD community. Our study suggests that GenAI can generate PLS that are as informative as conventional, human-written PLS, and achieve similar readability scores as judged by people living with SCD in the UK (mean 4.1 for human-written, 4.0 for AI and 3.9 for AI-hybrid). We propose that GenAI may offer an alternative to conventional human-written PLS, providing a time- and resource-efficient solution to increase accessibility to educational resources.",,0006-4971,144.0,,7668,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.",Forging; Preform design; Generative artificial intelligence,1526-6125,144.0,,190,208,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250929_0702.ris
A Bayesian ensemble approach for improved sustainable aviation fuel modeling,"Radaideh, Mohammed I.; Radaideh, Majdi I.; Violi, Angela",2025,2025/09/25/,Energy Conversion and Management: X,10.1016/j.ecmx.2025.101287,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590174525004192,"In this work, we introduce a new methodology to combine the available methods to predict the properties of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as aviation fuels. Due to the complexity of aviation fuels, the available methods perform well individually on some of the experimental observations and vice versa on others when a surrogate aviation fuel is defined and used. To this end, we introduce a new ensemble model based on the existing methods that combine and weigh their predictions. We employ the probabilistic Bayesian approach to predict aviation fuel properties with confidence levels. This is necessary because the available experimental data for aviation fuels is generally limited, which leads to overfitting. We adopt both “interpretable” Bayesian regression and a more “black-box” approach to Bayesian neural networks. An ensemble of predictive methods provided better predictions than the individual methods with robust confidence levels for three properties considered: mass density, kinematic viscosity, and flash point. A significant reduction in the mean absolute percentage error was obtained for mass density predictions, from 1.25% to 0.57% and 0.42%, using the Bayesian linear regression (BLR) and Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), respectively. The error in kinematic viscosity predictions was reduced from 17.25% to 9.02% and 6.79% using BLR and BNN, respectively. The error in flash point predictions is reduced from 9.04% to 5.83% by BLR and to 5.51% by BNN. The importance of the methods in the ensemble did not fully follow their individual performance, where the accurate models may not be the most important. The ensemble approach allows for the inclusion of new methods, even if they are slightly less accurate. This methodology can be extended to predict other aviation fuel properties and incorporate any predictive model. It also offers a way to generate valid training data for generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, helping to address the scarcity of aviation fuel data.",Sustainable aviation fuels; Bayesian regression; Bayesian neural networks; Uncertainty quantification; Ensemble mixing rules,2590-1745,,,101287,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides.

These GenAI tools empower marketers and malicious actors to create deepfakes, both authorized and weaponized multimedia, which allows them to include celebrities without appearing in front of cameras or creating seductive phishing scams. Although GenAI tools can reduce the cost of content construction, they enable new risky opportunities (e.g., deepfake phishing and cyberbullying) that negatively impact netizens’ learning and (dis)trust behaviors in cyberspace. To address such risks, this study proposes a Multi-Criteria-Multi-Decision-Makers (MCMDM)-based Deepfake Risk Assessment Framework (DeepFakeR-MF) to evaluate determinant factors that impact the cyber (dis)trust behaviors of netizens in deepfakes. Moreover, DeepFakeR-MF deploys a combination of a novel optimized spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method and a game theory-based MCMDM approach to prioritize and recommend alternative strategies that can be taken by five management sectors (e.g., industrial enterprises, governmental organizations, media outlets, social non-profit, and educational institutes) to mitigate GenAI-associated risks. Then, we collect 100 experts’ judgments by analyzing their responses to our questionnaire and prioritize the importance of determinant factors considering their preferences. To validate the prioritized factors on the performance of DeepFakeR-MF, we conduct a sensitivity analysis applying Monte Carlo statistical modeling.

The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives.

Existing generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI)-based visualization approaches often lack alignment with biophilic design principles, resulting in outputs that fail to reflect the restorative qualities of nature-integrated spaces. To address this limitation, the study links generative visualization processes to established biophilic frameworks, thereby enhancing the applicability of Gen AI in sustainable and human-centered architectural practice. The methodology follows a three-stage process: (1) exploration of biophilic visualization requirements through literature review and prompt testing, (2) development of the framework through domain-specific dataset construction, text mining, and prompt curation, and (3) expert evaluation of images generated using the structured prompts. The proposed framework consists of five components—subject, attribute, mood, time and background, and negative prompt—to guide the generation of BAS visualizations systematically. The generated images were assessed based on five criteria: domain fidelity, visual coherence, depth and perspective, spatial integration, and overall biophilic appeal. Results demonstrated substantial improvements—up to 75 % in domain fidelity and over 60 % in spatial integration and biophilic appeal—compared to early-tested prompts. These findings underscore the potential of structured prompts, grounded in biophilic design theory, to enhance the effectiveness of AI visualizations. This study offers a replicable and scalable method for integrating nature-based design principles into early-stage spatial planning.

In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.",Scientific journal cover design; Artificial intelligence; Midjourney; Stable diffusion; Deepseek; VIKOR,0141-9382,90.0,,103141,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250929_0702.ris

Despite a series of related studies and reviews around GAI, existing reviews predominantly focus on macro-level discussions covering overall development trends, core issues, opportunities and risks. There has been a lack of systematic reviews from a meso-level perspective examining the application of GAI in classroom teaching within higher education. This study employs a systematic literature review method, examining 139 articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Findings include: (1)In terms of disciplines and types of GAI applications, engineering, health and medicine, and language are the most popular, while humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and interdisciplinary fields have fewer applications. Based on Strobel's classification of GAI(2024), it is found that Generators, Reimaginators, and Assistants are the most widely applied types of GAI. In contrast, Synthesizers and Enablers are less commonly utilized. Regarding the adoption trends across disciplines, engineering and language have a diverse range of GAI product types applied, whereas health and medicine has fewer types of GAI products in use. Due to smaller sample sizes, the analysis of GAI product types in the remaining six disciplines is also relatively limited. (2)In terms of the application of GAI across different disciplines, a small portion of GAI applications reflect distinctive disciplinary characteristics. Regarding the roles mapped out by the application of GAI, based on Xu and Ouyang's classification(2022), instructors or students predominantly perceive GAI as “New Subject” or “Direct Mediator"", with less emphasis on the role of “Supplement Assistant”.

Risks to privacy and perpetuation of bias are more likely to be avoided if AI technologies in public health are designed with knowledge of community engagement, existing health disparities, and strategies for improving equity. This viewpoint proposes a multifaceted approach to ensure safer and more effective integration of AI in public health with the following call to action: (1) include the basics of AI technology in public health training and professional development; (2) use a community engagement approach to co-design AI technologies in public health; and (3) introduce governance and best practice mechanisms that can guide the use of AI in public health to prevent or mitigate potential harms. These actions will support the application of AI to varied public health domains through a framework for more transparent, responsive, and equitable use of this evolving technology, augmenting the work of public health practitioners and researchers to improve health outcomes while minimizing risks and unintended consequences.",Artificial Intelligence; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Citizen Science; Community Participation; Innovation Diffusion,1438-8871,27.0,,,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p7_20250929_0703.ris

Using data from public company filings, we analyze adoption rates, drivers and barriers, links to R&D investment, and industry-specific patterns. We find that firms with lower employee efficiency and greater size adopt AI more readily. AI adoption also correlates with changes in the scale and focus of R&D spending. Notably, retail and services firms—among the least efficient in terms of labor productivity—are leading in AI uptake.

Grounded in Allport's (1954) Contact Hypothesis and the Dual Identity Model (DIM; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), the study examines whether structured interactions with artificial humans can foster positive intergroup attitudes. Following the framework of E-contact interventions (White & Abu-Rayya, 2012), participants (N = 70 Caucasian university students) will engage in a within-between mixed-design experiment over three days. They will interact daily with an AI-powered 3D digital assistant representing either an outgroup member (Black avatar) or an ingroup member (White avatar) depending on the experimental condition, with pre- and post-intervention measures of intergroup attitudes. The structured interactions will follow the two-phase design of E-contact interventions, initially fostering personal acquaintance, then emphasizing group salience, and finally reinforcing a shared superordinate identity—a process aligned with the principles of DIM to maximize the generalization of positive intergroup attitudes. The virtual assistant will facilitate cooperative activities designed to enhance inclusivity, promote cultural exchange, and maintain subgroup distinctiveness while fostering a common identity. To ensure the effectiveness and coherence of the intervention, the scripted interactions will be pretested through a pilot study before implementation.

The field of design is propitious for such work because of the increasing use of technology and the necessity of introducing its critical use during study. Comprising two integrated modules, the system is based on a two-step workflow. The first step is anchored on ChatGPT, enabling students to prompt questions and receive answers. The second step allows for the generation of one or more images based on the system's answer to the initial question. Our research assesses whether our system can offer valuable insights and inspiration to students in their design work.

In this study, we demonstrate that ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)’, an artificial intelligence model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories akin to the vocabulary corpus of a language, we show that a GPT-based model can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables GPT to predict kinetically accurate sequences of states for a diverse set of biomolecules of varying complexity, at a much quicker pace than traditional MD simulations and with a better efficiency than other baseline time-series prediction approaches. More significantly, the approach is found to be equally adept at forecasting the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium active systems that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of the mechanism inherent in GPT reveals the crucial role of the ‘self-attention mechanism’ in capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions.

The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system.

This paper introduces an end-to-end method for qualitative codebook generation using the ChatGPT-3.5 Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Large Language Model (LLM) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) from OpenAI, comparing a human-in-the-loop GenAI-enabled approach with traditional qualitative coding through a case study of Twitter discourse on COVID-19 and climate change in Virginia (2020-2022). Methods build on prior work establishing qualitative analysis enhanced by Natural Language Processing (NLP) by stacking multiple iterative coding processes with GenAI and humans-in-the-loop to generate qualitative codebooks. A comparative analysis establishes recommendations for assessing the validity of the GPT-enabled generated codebooks. Human validation confirmed substantial concordance (91.7% agreement) with the GPT-enabled process's coding, revealing structural similarities and distinct patterns between the two approaches’ representation of analysis. This research's contribution is methodological, establishing an approach for conducting and assessing GPT-enabled qualitative analysis while mapping relationships between computationally enhanced and traditional qualitative coding approaches. Findings advance risk communication methods by offering empirical guidance on integrating AI-assisted techniques within traditional qualitative research to maintain analytical rigor. Compared to prior NLP-enabled methods for disaster-related social media discourse analysis, this iterative approach mimics aspects of traditional qualitative codebook development, yielding multi-tiered codebook structures that can capture aspects of complex disaster discourse.

However, further (empirical) research is needed to examine this phenomenon's adverse human rights implications. This paper analyses the potential adverse human rights impacts of the dissemination of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes in the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights and argues that the dissemination of such deepfakes can hinder the rights protected by the Convention. These include the right to respect for private and family life, as nonconsensual sexual deepfakes can undermine data protection, harm one's image and reputation, and compromise psychological integrity and personal autonomy. Additionally, such deepfakes can threaten freedom of expression by creating a silencing effect on public watchdogs, politicians, and private individuals. Finally, nonconsensual sexual deepfakes can impair the economic and moral rights of pornography performers by abusing their work and bodies to abuse others without authorization and compensation.

However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.",Lithium battery; Generative artificial intelligence; Material design; Microstructure characterization; State estimation,1000-6818,41.0,10,100115,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250929_0702.ris

The consequences will be felt across many sectors including health care, a critical sector for implementation of AI tools because glitches in algorithms or biases in training datasets may lead to suboptimal treatment that may negatively affect the health of an individual. The stakes are obviously higher in case of potentially life-threatening diseases such as cancer and therapies with a potential for causing severe or even fatal adverse events. Over the last two decades, much of the research on AI in health care has focussed on diagnostic radiology and digital pathology, but a solid body of research is emerging on AI tools in the radiation oncology workflow. Many of these applications are relatively uncontroversial, although there is still a lack of evidence regarding effectiveness rather than efficiency, and—the ultimate bar—evidence of clinical utility. Proponents of AI will argue that these algorithms should be implemented with robust human supervision. One challenge here is the deskilling effect associated with new technologies. We will become increasingly dependent on the AI tools over time, and we will become less capable of assessing the quality of the AI output. Much of this research appears almost old-fashioned in view of the rapid advances in Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI can draw from multiple types of data and produce output that is personalised and appears relevant in the given context. Especially the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened a wide field of potential applications that were out of bounds just a few years ago. One LLM, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), has been made widely accessible to end-users as ChatGPT-4, which passed a rigorous Turing test in a recent study. In this viewpoint, I argue for the necessity of independent academic research to establish evidence-based applications of AI in medicine. Algorithmic medicine is an intervention similar to a new drug or a new medical device. We should be especially concerned about under-represented minorities and rare/atypical clinical cases that may drown in the petabyte-sized training sets. A huge educational push is needed to ensure that the end-users of AI in health care understand the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic medicine. Finally, we need to address the ethical boundaries for where and when GenAI can replace humans in the relation between patients and healthcare providers.",,0936-6555,41.0,,103798,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify—and localize—virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient’s bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks.

However, the factors associated with SPI at team level remain underexplored. This study examines the roles of team skill differentiation and team adaptability in fostering SPI, proposing that these factors support teams in the pursuit of sustainability-oriented innovation more effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in shaping the strength of these relationships. Drawing on the double diamond framework and its AI-augmented adaptation, we hypothesize that skill differentiation expands the range of potential solutions in the divergent phase of innovation, while adaptability enhances responsiveness in the convergent phase. GenAI is posited to enhance these effects by augmenting knowledge recombination and real-time strategic adaptation. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a multi-industry survey of NPD teams engaged in sustainability initiatives, applying multiple regression analysis to assess the proposed relationships. All our hypotheses were empirically supported. Overall, this study contributes to SPI research by integrating team capability theory with AI-driven innovation frameworks. The findings highlight the need for firms to cultivate multidisciplinary teams with adaptive capacities while leveraging GenAI as an amplifier rather than a substitute for human expertise. The results also underscore that effective SPI requires both internal knowledge diversity and external responsiveness, alongside AI tools that enhance creativity and sustainability-driven decision-making.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of GenAI on performance by examining a key affordance of GenAI—seeking help via question asking. We compared the questions that learners asked GenAI versus a human tutor online during a writing task. Using quantitative ethnographic methods, we found that: (a) participants in the GenAI condition asked significantly more questions compared to those in the Tutor condition; (b) GenAI participants tended to ask one-off questions, while Tutor participants tended to have longer conversational exchanges; (c) GenAI participants tended to question pragmatically, asking direct questions about conceptual and procedural knowledge, while Tutor participants tended to make indirect request for feedback; (d) question asking, as measured by epistemic network analysis, mediated the relationship between experimental condition and performance—the more pragmatic the questions, and thus the more like questions in the GenAI condition, the better the performance; and (e) questions in the GenAI condition were driven by social coordination and knowledge deficits, while questions in the Tutor condition were driven by social coordination and establishing common ground. These findings suggest learners may be less hesitant to admit knowledge deficits and more willing to repair them when interacting with GenAI compared to human tutors.

This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning.

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism.

Current GL paradigms extremely emphasize absolute fairness and impartiality for all clients. This limits its flexibility and adaptability in addressing specific circumstances that demand customizable model queries (e.g., access control and intellectual property protection), where authorizable GL models present non-trivial obstacles in realization. Inspired by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), to overcome this limitation, we propose Auth-Graph, the first authorizable GL methodology via a built-in-model access control mechanism. Specifically, our Auth-Graph employs a generative perturbating-driven backdoor to reach authorizable access. The activation of the backdoor is exclusively confined to rightly masked and perturbed inputs, which yield accurate results, whereas all other inputs induce the GL model to produce erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to strengthen compatibility and support multi-user functionality, the masking mechanism operates correctly with a generative masker solely for authorized users possessing valid tokens, with each user’s token being uniquely distinct. Empirical results across benchmark GL models and datasets substantiate that Auth-Graph robustly prevents unauthorized access (average accuracy 3.68%) while promoting legitimate users to attain standard outputs (average accuracy drop 3.45%).",Graph learning; Generative artificial intelligence; Authorizable access; Access control; Backdoor paradigm,1566-2535,124.0,,103375,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

Based on an exploratory multiple-case study of five undergraduate PSTs in Hong Kong, this paper adopts the model of L2 investment (Darvin & Norton, 2015) to address this need by posing three question: 1.

Through an IoT sensor network, the system collects critical data on environmental parameters and hive conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and hive weight, processing them locally at the edge or centrally in the cloud. The architecture incorporates a recommendation system that uses a small language model (SLM) to generate real-time alerts based on data provided by the IoT sensors. This system implements two distinct SLM models, Phi-3.5 and Tinyllama, enabling hardware performance measurement and optimizing efficiency for edge processing. To establish optimal environmental ranges, the recommendation system uses bio-inspired algorithms, such as ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and bee swarm algorithms. Additionally, LSTM neural networks are included to predict honey production and plan hive placement based on climate and weight projections, allowing for precise and personalized adjustments. This dual processing capability (edge and cloud) reduces the need for human intervention, optimizes hive inspection times, and minimizes false positives in monitoring, making it especially beneficial for large-scale beekeeping, where weekly inspection times can exceed 50 h.

It is unclear in which behavioral settings these chatbots deliver value to the buying firm in terms of economic, psychological, and relational outcomes. To fill this gap, we conduct three experiments in buyer–supplier negotiation settings, two in a lab-setting with undergraduate business students and one online experiment with professional negotiators. In our interactive simulations, participants play the role of the supplier, while a ChatGPT-based custom-trained chatbot acts as the buyer. We find that when the chatbot deploys a competitive, as compared to a collaborative, negotiation approach, it will achieve a higher price discount, better payment terms, and a quicker negotiation. However, suppliers trust a collaboratively prompted, as compared to a competitively prompted, chatbot more and demonstrate higher outcome satisfaction, as well as a stronger desire for future interaction. A text analysis of the chat interactions indicates a higher level of similarity when a competitively prompted chatbot is employed, which implies that suppliers also use more insistent and intimidating language, thereby matching the chatbot's negotiation approach to a greater degree. While the negotiation approach is a significant influencing factor, we do not find significant evidence that item type, in our case non-critical or bottleneck, matters, which indicates that AI-based chatbots can be effective in various buyer–supplier settings.",Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; Negotiation,1478-4092,31.0,4,101012,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p4_20250929_0703.ris

Existing studies often focus on specific domains without addressing broader trust-building mechanisms or the cognitive and motivational factors needed for sustained engagement. This study investigates how trust shapes the adoption of GAI-driven sustainability recommendations by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) into a single framework. Using data from sustainability-oriented users, we examine how central route constructs-perceived information quality and utility-peripheral route constructs-anthropomorphism and interaction quality-enhance trust, while perceived information complexity and perceived risk moderate these relationships. Our findings indicate that high-quality, useful information enhances trust through cognitive engagement, whereas anthropomorphic design and interaction quality reinforce trust via the heuristic route.

This impact is likely to accelerate and become even more significant as the computational potential of generative AI grows through training on more diverse and more extensive language models and data sets. Emerging research in this new field suggests that previous models of understanding the interactions between machine and human may no longer be sufficient in a world of generative AI. The significant question is how emerging generative AI technologies will relate to and be a part of human creativity and creative outputs. In this article, we adopt a posthuman stance and conceive of creative output involving generative AI and humans in terms of a yet-to-be-fully-realised and emergent relationship that will likely become more integrated and complex. To investigate and experiment with this relational notion, each of us (as part of an autoethnographic approach) developed a creative output using ChatGPT: a poem and a multimodal narrative. We then employed the idea of alterity relations from the American philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, to conceive of the possibilities and limitations in working relationally and productively with generative AI. As two academics working in teacher education, we applied our learning from this exploration to possibilities in educational contexts. In this article, we offer several important implications and provocations for practitioners, researchers, educators and policymakers, not only in terms of practical concerns but also for rethinking the nature of the creative output.",Generative AI; Creative production; Posthumanism; Education; Autoethnography; Alterity relations,1871-1871,56.0,,101727,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

EFL learners’ perceptual perezhivaniya and actual writing revision behaviors mediated by GenAI: A sociocultural theory perspective,"Qin, Lili; Dong, Jingjing",2025,2025/10/01/,System,10.1016/j.system.2025.103769,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X25001794,"In recent years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has gained prominence as a valuable tool in enhancing EFL learners’ experiences in Second Language Acquisition (SLA). However, empirical studies specifically investigating on GenAI’s role in mediating the revision stage of EFL learners’ L2 writing processes remain scarce. Notably, research exploring the connection between learners’ perceived perezhivaniya—derived from Vygotskyan theory, denoting an individual’’s subjective lived experiences—and their actual revision behaviors is particularly limited. To address this lacuna, we employed interviews, Q-methodology, and the Translog screen recording tool to investigate the revision processes of nineteen EFL learners at a university in Southern China as they revised L2 continuation writing tasks using GenAI. A key contribution of this study is the development of a novel seven-dimensional L2 writing revision taxonomy (word choice, content, discourse, syntax, errors, alignment, and typographic elements), which guided both the Q-questionnaire design and the Translog data coding. This framework uniquely facilitated a comparison between perceived perezhivaniya and actual revision behaviors by integrating online revision with offline reflective perceptions, thereby capturing an essential dynamic aspect of the concept of perezhivanie. Results indicated a strong consistency between most of the learners’ perceived experiences and their actual revision behaviors, in content, alignment, and typographic elements. However, for some learners, alignment—vital for continuation writing—was frequently overlooked despite its perceptual recognition, highlighting significant pedagogical implications.",,0346-251X,133.0,,103769,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate.",Achievement goal theory; Emotional engagement; Generative artificial intelligence (GAI); Goal orientation; L2 education; Motivational climate theory (MCT); Self-determination theory (SDT),0023-9690,90.0,,102114,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM), the present study employs latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered approach that identifies distinct profiles of EFL learners’ engagement in GenAI-assisted writing. A one-way ANOVA is subsequently conducted to examine whether students’ attitudes toward GenAI differed across these engagement profiles. In addition, semi-structured interviews are conducted to investigate university teachers’ perceptions of how GenAI can enhance students’ writing engagement. The LPA identifies three engagement profiles as high engagement (31.9 %), medium engagement (50.8 %), and low engagement (17.3 %). However, GenAI attitude did not show a significant relationship with writing engagement. Qualitative findings indicate that teachers are aware of GenAI’s potential in improving students’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, though few have actively integrated such tools into their teaching.

Moreover, statistical analysis also verified the scale's convergent validity and reliability in measuring the construct of GenAI literacy. We anticipate that this EFL teachers' GenAI literacy scale will guide teachers and teacher educators in enhancing GenAI capabilities for professional growth.

Despite their transformative potential, many professionals remain cautious about using these tools for drafting and editing manuscripts. While it is reasonable for academic journals to request transparency regarding AI usage, fundamental reservations against employing generative AI (GenAI) are outdated. A useful analogy can be drawn from the film Hidden Figures, which depicts the arrival of IBM computers at NASA, eventually replacing human “computers” for manual calculations. Dorothy Vaughan, the supervisor of these human experts, anticipated the change and adapted proactively by teaching her team programming skills. Today, it is unthinkable for scientific calculations to be done without software, just as it will soon be unthinkable to draft professional texts without AI assistance. GenAI should be seen as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than replacing it. By handling mundane aspects of writing, it allows authors to focus on critical thinking and idea generation. Transparency in AI use fosters trust and maintains ethical standards. Authors are encouraged to use GenAI under supervision and disclose its use openly.

Enhancing pre-service teachers' reflective thinking skills through generative AI-assisted digital storytelling creation: A three-dimensional framework analysis,"Wei, Xiaodong; Wang, Lei; Koszalka, Tiffany A.; Lee, Lap-Kei; Liu, Ruixue",2025,2025/10/01/,Computers & Education,10.1016/j.compedu.2025.105356,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131525001241,"Developing reflective thinking skills (RTS) in pre-service teachers remains a challenge in teacher education, particularly in the context of integrating emerging technologies. While digital storytelling (DST) has shown promise in fostering reflective practice, traditional methods often present technical barriers that hinder deeper reflection. Few studies have explored how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can support RTS during DST creation. This study addresses these gaps by adopting a three-dimensional framework of RTS, which included the time of reflection, objects of reflection, and levels of reflection, to guide and assess the impact of GAI-assisted DST creation on pre-service teachers' reflective patterns. Employing a post-test quasi-experimental design, eighty pre-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group utilizing GAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway) for DST creation, and a control group utilizing traditional methods. Results revealed that the experimental group significantly improved RTS in time, objects, and levels of reflection. Pre-service teachers in the experimental group reflected more on problem definition and solution generation during the design stages of reflection time. Regarding reflection objects, the experimental group exhibited significantly higher reflection frequencies across self, artifacts, and circumstances aspects. Additionally, pre-service teachers in experimental group demonstrated significantly higher reflection frequencies at all levels—single-loop, double-loop, and triple-loop—compared to the control group. Single-loop reflection was the most common, while triple-loop reflection was the least frequent in both groups. These findings underline GAI's potential to scaffold RTS and enhance the DST creation process, offering valuable insights for integrating GAI into teacher education to foster deeper reflective practice.",Improving classroom teaching; Media in education; Teacher professional development; Teaching/learning strategies; 21st century abilities,0360-1315,235.0,,105356,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning.

However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.",,0749-8063,41.0,4,874,885,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250929_0703.ris

Our person-centered latent profile analysis of 193 EFL learners revealed four groups of students with diverse GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy levels: highly confident all-rounders, practical assistance seekers, interaction-oriented communicators, and unconfident less-adaptable users. These four profiles were found to be closely tied to their writing SRL strategy use. Furthermore, years of English learning experience and perceived English proficiency seemed to be significant antecedents of EFL learners’ GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy profiles. These findings could chart new ways for EFL writing syllabus design in the GenAI context.","Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI); Writing self-efficacy; Writing self-regulated learning strategies; EFL writing performance,",0346-251X,134.0,,103826,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

An experiment between humans and GAI chatbots in determining product promotion strategy showed that emotional prompts impact individuals' reappraisals of both chatbots and their own performance profoundly, cultivating self-determination in the final decision. Importantly, EmotionPrompt with promotion orientation can increase the perceived flexibility of chatbot decision-makers, facilitating individual self-enhancement and trust in GAI competence. In contrast, the prevention-oriented EmotionPrompt appears to constrain individuals' judgments and decision-making processes, as evidenced by the increased occurrence of inhibit words and anxiety emotions in their reflections.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on how individual factors affect GAI risk perception while the technical functions and features that are the root causes of user concerns regarding GAI remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study, grounded in affordance theory, explored how perceived affordances of GAI influenced user risk perceptions across six dimensions: information, security, technical, social, ethical, and legal. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on a survey of 1,031 GAI users to examine the impact of interactivity, agency, and security affordances on these risk dimensions. The results indicate that higher perceptions of affordances such as bandwidth, synchrony, and transparency are significantly associated with lower risk perceptions across all dimensions. Notably, women reported higher perceived risks than men in most categories, whereas age and GAI usage experience did not significantly affect these perceptions. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing user control, transparency, and privacy protections in GAI system design to effectively mitigate perceived risks.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies plays a vital role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of B5G networks. However, the dynamic and ever-evolving service demands associated with B5G use cases lead to the occurrence of drift, which can significantly degrade the performance of AI/ML models. Drift occurrence often results in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and over- or under-provisioning of resources, ultimately impacting user experience and network reliability. Drift detection and adaptation are essential for addressing the dynamic service demands of B5G networks. Existing threshold approach and various other frameworks, have significant limitations, — SLA violations from delayed drift detection and inefficient resource management due to frequent retraining. This paper proposes a drift handling framework that determines drift promptly after its occurrence using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI). The proposed Gen-AI framework is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community (OSC) platform and compared to the existing threshold and other frameworks. Also, a real-time dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate the Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed Gen-AI framework for drift handling. The results demonstrate that the proposed Gen-AI framework leverages both Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), significantly enhances drift detection and adaptation time in B5G networks. Specifically, in the QoS prediction use case, GAN achieves 98% drift detection accuracy, while the VAE achieves 95% , compared to 85% for the classifier framework, 25% for the threshold-based approach. In addition, a similar kind of results is observed in case of the network slicing use case. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Gen-AI framework in proactively handling drift with reduced detection and adaptation time, making it a promising solution for B5G networks.",Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks; Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI); Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML); Drift detection and adaptation; Service Level Agreements (SLAs),1389-1286,263.0,,111237,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p7_20250929_0703.ris

However, with the rapid evolution of consumer demands, traditional aesthetic design processes for personalized products face significant challenges. The core challenge lies in effectively integrating Generative AI, individual differences, and style-based user preference modeling into the personalized product design workflow. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates style-themed information into the generation and evaluation of personalized product aesthetics and a new dataset. In the personalized aesthetic generation phase, a predictive model is developed to infer consumer style preferences. The top-ranked styles are then used as conditional inputs to guide the generation of conceptual design solutions. In the personalized aesthetic evaluation phase, a personalized aesthetic evaluation incorporating style themes is conducted using a hybrid model that combines interaction matrix with collaborative filtering. The proposed method is empirically validated through a case study involving wristwatch design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both aesthetic design generation and aesthetic personalized evaluation. It proves especially effective in enhancing design efficiency and meeting personalized product aesthetic preferences.",Personalized product; Personalized aesthetic preference evaluation; Generative artificial intelligence; Design iteration,1474-0346,68.0,,103756,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p6_20250929_0703.ris

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI’s practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology for generating and completing PMU phasor measurements using Generative Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on real-world PMU datasets to learn the underlying empirical data distributions without assuming predefined statistical models. The proposed deep generative models are evaluated against traditional statistical techniques based on Gaussian Copulas using a suite of distributional similarity metrics, including Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, Hellinger distance, Maximum Deviation Nearest Neighbor (MDNN), and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. The GAN model achieved the best distributional fidelity, with KL divergence as low as 0.0106 and Hellinger distance of 0.0435 for voltage signals. In a synthetic data reconstruction task with 0.5% missing values, the GAN reduced the percentage root mean squared error (PRMSE) to 0.52% for voltage and 2.19% for current—significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, the GAN was able to augment the dataset from 1489 to 5000 samples while preserving key statistical properties, as validated by empirical distribution tests.

However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of advanced deep generative models, such as GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models, transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. Current IoT and AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges such as data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate context-awareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance IoT and AIoT functionalities across key domains—namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, cybersecurity, network traffic, and anomaly detection—while examining their synergistic potential to improve environmental performance in sustainable smart cities. Key findings reveal that emerging advancements in integrating GenAI with IoT and AIoT systems greatly improve urban adaptability, autonomy, and resilience by fostering more dynamic, autonomous, and robust systems and infrastructures. Generative models advance the five core pillars of AIoT: sensing, perceiving, learning, visualizing, and decision-making, by enabling proactive, context-aware, and self-adaptive urban systems to enhance their environmental performance. The fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient IoT and AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy.

However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.",Semantic communication; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language model; Variational autoencoder; Generative adversarial network; Diffusion model,2095-8099,,,,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p7_20250929_0703.ris

To address these issues, this paper introduces generative video communication, a novel paradigm that leverages generative artificial intelligence technologies to enhance video content expression. The core objective is to improve the expressive capabilities of video communication by enabling new gains in the cognitive domain (i.e., content dimension) while complementing existing frameworks. This paper presents key technical pathways for the proposed paradigm, including elastic encoding, collaborative transmission, and trustworthy evaluation, and explores its potential applications in task-oriented and immersive communication.

This study focused on the use of ChatGPT by undergraduate management students. We developed a model called the “AI Student Satisfaction with Studies model” (AI 3S-model) to investigate how generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, affects student satisfaction with their management studies. Factors used in the model included AI-related student expectations, AI-related student job expectations, perceived quality of AI among students, and AI-related overall student satisfaction. An online questionnaire was administered to students from economics faculties at various universities in the Czech Republic. We deliberately focused on one specialized economics college and several large economics faculties. The sample comprised 231 respondents. To analyze the data, we applied covariance-based structural equation modelling using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings indicate that two factors directly and positively affect overall student satisfaction with AI use: their perceived quality of studies and their expectations. Additionally, perceived quality acts as a significant mediator between student expectations and overall satisfaction, as well as between job expectations and overall satisfaction. Students believe that ChatGPT enhances their quality of education, which boosts their overall satisfaction. For management education programs, this means that finding ways to effectively integrate generative AI into students’ learning and establishing reasonable limits is highly beneficial, whereas prohibiting the use of generative AI tools would likely decrease student satisfaction and diminish the perceived quality of their studies.",Generative artificial intelligence (AI); ChatGPT; Management studies; Student satisfaction; AI student satisfaction with studies model,2444-569X,10.0,5,100781,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

In response, HEIs focused on regulating its use, particularly among students, before shifting towards advocating for its productive integration within teaching and learning. Since then, many HEIs have increasingly provided policies and guidelines to direct GenAI. This paper presents an analysis of documents produced by 116 US universities classified as as high research activity or R1 institutions providing a comprehensive examination of the advice and guidance offered by institutional stakeholders about GenAI. Through an extensive analysis, we found a majority of universities (N = 73, 63%) encourage the use of GenAI, with many offering detailed guidance for its use in the classroom (N = 48, 41%). Over half the institutions provided sample syllabi (N = 65, 56%) and half (N = 58, 50%) provided sample GenAI curriculum and activities that would help instructors integrate and leverage GenAI in their teaching. Notably, the majority of guidance focused on writing activities focused on writing, whereas references to code and STEM-related activities were infrequent, and often vague, even when mentioned (N = 58, 50%). Finally, more than half of institutions talked about the ethics of GenAI on a broad range of topics, including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) (N = 60, 52%).

This symposium paper seeks to summarize current recommendations on the use of GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, and to provide speculations about the future challenges and opportunities of GenAI use in scientific publishing. Due to the dynamic nature of these tools and the rapid advancement of their sophistication, the most important recommendation is that ongoing engagement and discussion within the scientific community about these issues is critical. When using GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, humans are ultimately accountable and responsible for products produced. Given that accountability, an expert panel convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently proposed principles of GenAI use in science communication, including (1) transparent disclosure and attribution; (2) verification of AI-generated content and analyses; (3) documentation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated data; (4) a focus on ethics and equity; and (5) continuous monitoring, oversight, and public engagement. In addition to the importance of human accountability, many publishers have established consistent policies suggesting that GenAI tools should not be used for peer reviewing, figure generation or manipulation, or assigned authorship on scientific articles. Along with the potential ethical challenges associated with GenAI use in scientific publishing, there are numerous potential benefits. Herein we summarize example conversations demonstrating the capacity of GenAI tools to support the article preparation process, and an example standard operating procedure for human-AI interaction in article preparation.

To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",Sustainable smart cities; Generative artificial intelligence; Generative spatial artificial intelligence; Foundation models; Large flow model; Urban digital twin; Urban planning and design,2666-4984,24.0,,100526,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p7_20250929_0703.ris

However, deducing these equation-based models requires extensive trial-and-error and strong intuitions. While neural networks may enable the parameterization of material models, they require additional costs for supervised learning and may lead to slower inference. In this paper, we introduce a generative artificial intelligence approach that does not require additional supervised learning to recover the yield surface. Instead, a generative latent diffusion model allows us to deduce yield points with maximum likelihood in the stress space, allowing the model to generalize from sparse or incomplete experimental data. A new projection-based stress update algorithm designed specifically for the mesh-based models enables parallelized integration without the numerical instability or high computational cost of traditional return mapping schemes. Numerical benchmarks–ranging from classical plasticity models to data from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of single-crystal copper–demonstrate that the proposed framework improves robustness, scalability, and inference accuracy. This work contributes a new class of data-driven plasticity models that are computationally efficient and well-suited for complex, path-dependent material behaviors.",Plasticity; Mesh; Triangulation; Generative artificial intelligence,0045-7825,446.0,,118310,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p6_20250929_0703.ris

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.",Control structure prediction; Graph-to-sequence; Process graph; SFILES 2.0; Generative artificial intelligence,0098-1354,199.0,,109121,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p3_20250929_0703.ris

However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output.

In this paper, we introduce the NATION approach, an innovative GAN-based framework that advances multi-party data publishing through sophisticated information fusion techniques while maintaining stringent differential privacy guarantees and computational efficiency. In NATION, we modify the traditional GAN architecture through a distributed design where multiple discriminators are strategically allocated across parties while centralizing the generator at a semi-trusted server, enabling seamless fusion of distributed knowledge with minimal computational cost. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key technical innovations: an iterative-aware adaptive noise IAN method that dynamically optimizes noise injection based on training convergence, and a global-aware discriminator regularization GDR method that leverages Bregman Divergence to enhance inter-discriminator information exchange while ensuring model stability.

The results of two studies reveal that moderate green in AI-generated content (compared to non-green content) awakens consumers' pro-environmental perceptions, consequently increasing their purchase intention. However, excessive green in AI-generated content (compared to moderate green content) evokes skepticism related to greenwashing, which, in turn, negatively impacts their intention to purchase. Additionally, perceived experience and agency positively moderate the relationships between the different strategies of using AI-generated green marketing content and consumers' reactions.

This study investigated the effects of a novel learning approach—GenAI-assisted collaborative prewriting (GACP)—and conducted a comparative analysis with GenAI-assisted individual prewriting (GAIP). The focus was on students' interactions with GenAI, the quality of their outlines, and their task motivation. Employing a within-subjects design, this study involved sixty-nine Chinese undergraduates. We collected and analyzed multiple data sources, including chat histories between students and a GenAI tool, writing outlines, and post-task questionnaires. The results revealed that students' objectives for using GenAI in outline creation were largely consistent across both conditions, with brainstorming emerging as the most common goal. Notably, peer collaboration was found to facilitate more effective prompts for eliciting desired responses from GenAI and to mitigate potential misuse of the tool. Additionally, GACP led to higher content quality in outline writing, although improvements in organization and language were less pronounced. Furthermore, students in the GACP setting reported greater confidence in their writing outcomes, although no statistically significant differences in overall task motivation were observed. These findings enhance our understanding of GenAI's potential in supporting EFL writing and suggest that collaborative use of GenAI can further enrich student learning experiences.",Generative artificial intelligence; EFL writing; Collaborative writing; Prewriting; Outline writing,0346-251X,135.0,,103857,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data.

Industrial dataset are now available with the introduction of Digital Radiography (DR) X-ray machine and are the basis for Automated Defect Recognition (ADR) systems based on Neural Network (NN) object detection models. However, building a big enough dataset is not easy and takes a long time in a production environment, delaying the introduction of ADR models. A potential solution is to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to synthesise new images. However, these models fail to generate full realistic images due to the subtle nature of X-ray images. Hence, this paper propose a combination of flawless images and synthetic defects generated by a novel Scalable Conditional Wasserstein GAN (SCWGAN) model. Such synthetic defects are introduced in the target images by a location algorithm that uses a mask image defining the allowable defective areas, the expected Gaussian or Poisson noise level and the defect size and aspect ratio. By creating such synthetic dataset and combine it with the original GDXRay dataset, our proposed detection system achieves an improvement of 17% in mAP@IoU=0.5:0.95 (our target metric to reduced uncertainty on defect location) with regards the baseline model trained with only real images.

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs.

Rockbursts, as a dynamic geological disaster, pose a serious threat to the safety and efficient tunneling of TBMs. The microseismic monitoring technique provides an effective solution for rockburst warning. However, due to the complexity and variability of the TBM excavation environment, microseismic events induced by rock fracture are often accompanied by interference events, such as electrical noise, TBM vibration, and mechanical knock. This study proposes a multi-channel intelligent classification approach for microseismic events in TBM excavation scenarios, based on double-layer stacking learning, to identify rock fractures. In this approach, decision tree is used as the base classifier on each microseismic channel, while extreme learning machine is employed as the meta-classifier to aggregate all base classifiers. Additionally, mind evolutionary computation is integrated to optimize the built-in hyperparameters of various classifiers.

Introduction of the AI-Interaction Positivity Scale and its relations to satisfaction with life and trust in ChatGPT,"Montag, Christian; Elhai, Jon D.",2025,2025/11/01/,Computers in Human Behavior,10.1016/j.chb.2025.108705,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563225001529,"In November 2022, the generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was presented to the world, and millions of users started to interact with this tool in a short time. Therefore, the present research aimed to investigate individual differences in trusting ChatGPT and other generative AI tools by asking study participants not only about trust in these products but also to explore associations with the attitude towards AI (ATAI) scale and a newly developed measure called the AI-Interaction Positivity Scale (AI-IPS) scale. Of note, further associations between all investigated variables are also presented. The AI-IPS investigates the degree to which humans experience positive emotions and are satisfied when interacting with products in which AI is built in. A final sample of n = 1073 was analyzed, and it was demonstrated that the new AI-IPS has sufficient psychometric properties and is positively linked to trusting ChatGPT (r = 0.698; here a subsample of n = 649 participants was investigated to determine trust in ChatGPT). Of note, this observed association was comparable (although a bit higher) to correlations between positive attitudes towards AI and trust in ChatGPT. Of further interest, satisfaction with life was assessed. Here, a mild positive association between AI-Interaction Positivity and life satisfaction was demonstrated (r = 0.214). This observation leads to interesting new research questions, namely, the potential causality between these variables (please note that causality cannot be established here because of the cross-sectional nature of the present work).",ChatGPT; Trust; Generative artificial intelligence; Well-being; Life satisfaction; AI-Well-being; AI-Interaction Positivity,0747-5632,172.0,,108705,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like language, which can enhance various aspects of healthcare, including clinical decision-making and psychological counseling. LLMs, trained on vast datasets, function by predicting the next word in a sequence, endowing them with extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. Their adaptability allows them to perform a wide range of language-related tasks, significantly contributing to advancements in cognitive psychology and psychiatry. These models demonstrate proficiency in tasks such as analogical reasoning, metaphor comprehension, and problem-solving, often achieving performance comparable to neurotypical humans. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs still exhibit limitations in causal reasoning and complex planning. However, their continuous improvement, exemplified by the enhanced performance of GPT-4 over its predecessors, suggests a trajectory towards overcoming these challenges. The ongoing debate about the “intelligence” of LLMs revolves around their ability to mimic human-like reasoning and understanding, a focal point of contemporary research. This paper explores the cognitive abilities of LLMs, comparing them with human cognitive processes and examining their performance on various psychological tests. It highlights the emergent properties of LLMs, their potential to transform cognitive psychology, and the different applications of LLMs in psychiatry, highlighting the limitations, the ethical considerations, and the importance of scaling and fine-tuning these models to enhance their capabilities. We also explore the parallels between LLMs and human error patterns, underscoring the significance of using LLMs as models for human cognition.

These issues are particularly pronounced for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), who often experience distressing symptoms and struggle with educational materials due to complex jargon, fatigue, or reading level mismatches. To address these issues, we developed and assessed the feasibility of a digital health platform, CRCWeb, to improve the accessibility of educational resources on symptom management for disadvantaged patients with CRC and their caregivers facing limited health literacy or low income. CRCWeb was developed through a stakeholder-centered participatory design approach. Two-phase semistructured interviews with patients, caregivers, and oncology experts informed the iterative design process. From the interviews, we developed the following 5 key design principles: user-friendly navigation, multimedia integration, concise and clear content, enhanced accessibility for individuals with vision and reading disabilities, and scalability for future content expansion. Initial feedback from iterative stakeholder engagements confirmed high user satisfaction, with participants rating CRCWeb an average of 3.98 out of 5 on the postintervention survey. Additionally, using generative artificial intelligence tools, including large language models like ChatGPT and multimedia generation tools such as Pictory, complex health care guidelines were transformed into concise, easily comprehensible multimedia content, and made accessible through CRCWeb. User engagement was notably higher among disadvantaged participants with limited health literacy or low income, who logged into the platform 2.52 times more frequently than nondisadvantaged participants.

Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.",educational technology; retrieval practice; flipped classroom; cognitive engagement; personalized learning; generative artificial intelligence; higher education; university education; learners; instructors; curriculum structure; learning; technologies; innovation; academic misconduct; gamification; self-directed; socio-economic disparities; interactive approach; medical education; chatGPT; machine learning; AI; large language models,2369-3762,11.0,,,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p1_20250929_0702.ris
Leveraging Large Language Model ChatGPT for enhanced understanding of end-user emotions in social media feedbacks,"Khan, Nek Dil; Khan, Javed Ali; Li, Jianqiang; Ullah, Tahir; Zhao, Qing",2025,2025/02/01/,Expert Systems with Applications,10.1016/j.eswa.2024.125524,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424023911,"For software evolution, user feedback has become a meaningful way to improve applications. Recent studies show a significant increase in analyzing end-user feedback from various social media platforms for software evolution. However, less attention has been given to the end-user feedback for low-rating software applications. Also, such approaches are developed mainly on the understanding of human annotators who might have subconsciously tried for a second guess, questioning the validity of the methods. For this purpose, we proposed an approach that analyzes end-user feedback for low-rating applications to identify the end-user opinion types associated with negative reviews (an issue or bug). Also, we utilized Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., ChatGPT, as an annotator and negotiator when preparing a truth set for the deep learning (DL) classifiers to identify end-user emotion. For the proposed approach, we first used the ChatGPT Application Programming Interface (API) to identify negative end-user feedback by processing 71853 reviews collected from 45 apps in the Amazon store. Next, a novel grounded theory is developed by manually processing end-user negative feedback to identify frequently associated emotion types, including anger, confusion, disgust, distrust, disappointment, fear, frustration, and sadness. Next, two datasets were developed, one with human annotators using a content analysis approach and the other using ChatGPT API with the identified emotion types. Next, another round is conducted with ChatGPT to negotiate over the conflicts with the human-annotated dataset, resulting in a conflict-free emotion detection dataset. Finally, various DL classifiers, including LSTM, BILSTM, CNN, RNN, GRU, BiGRU and BiRNN, are employed to identify their efficacy in detecting end-users emotions by preprocessing the input data, applying feature engineering, balancing the data set, and then training and testing them using a cross-validation approach. We obtained an average accuracy of 94%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 91%, and 85%, with LSTM, BILSTM, RNN, CNN, GRU, BiGRU and BiRNN, respectively, showing improved results with the truth set curated with human and ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT as an annotator and negotiator can help automate and validate the annotation process, resulting in better DL performances.",Data-driven requirements engineering; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Sentiment Analysis; Large Language Models; Software evolution; ChatGPT,0957-4174,261.0,,125524,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

This study examines the effectiveness of Transformer-type generative AI models in predicting cattle behaviour profiles and imputing missing data from collar accelerometer readings collected during two trials in Queensland, Australia, in 2022 and 2023, alongside climatic data. Each trial involved 60 cattle equipped with collars that classified six core behaviours: grazing, ruminating, walking, resting, drinking, and other over five-second time windows. Hourly behaviour profiles were constructed for each animal and experiment day by aggregating the behaviour predictions over every calendar hour, representing the time spent on each behaviour within each hour. Subsequently, four Transformer-type models (i.e., standard Transformer, Informer, Reformer, and Autoformer) were trained on the hourly behaviour profile data to predict behaviour profiles of the next 24 hours for each animal. Among the considered models, Autoformer showed the highest predictive accuracy when including climate data, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of <5.5 min, while the next best model had an MAE of approximately 6 min. For imputing missing data, the standard Transformer outperformed traditional imputation methods, with an MAE of <30 min over 24 hours, compared to 40 to 70 min for traditional methods (mean, median, and linear interpolation). These results highlight the potential of generative AI, particularly Autoformer and Transformer, to enhance predictive accuracy and data imputation in livestock management, thereby supporting regulatory guidance for data-driven decision-making and improved farming practices.",Accelerometer data; Cattle behaviour; Data imputation; Generative AI; Precision agriculture,2772-3755,11.0,,100987,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed framework, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and perceived AI threat. The results indicate that PE, EE, and SI had significant positive effects on behavioral intention, whereas FC was not a significant predictor. Perceived AI threat demonstrated a strong negative impact on adoption intentions, particularly by moderating and weakening the positive effects of PE and SI. The model explained 79.8 % of the variance in AI adoption intention, suggesting a substantial predictive power. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of addressing existential fears regarding AI in healthcare. Interventions targeting user training, transparent communication, and regulatory support may help mitigate perceived threats and harness AI's benefits.

In the context of Parathyroid Glands detection in Nuclear Medicine, physicians rely on a subtraction process involving two different images. Consequently, the subtracted image depends entirely on the two images. This methodology is manual, time-consuming, and depends entirely on medical expertise. Conditional GAI, a sub-field of GAI, generates new data based on input specifications, enabling more controlled results. However, generative models require a large amount of data and still present limitations in precisely controlling outputs over inputs. This paper presents a new model named Nuclear Medicine U-Net Siamese Network (NM-USNet) based on a combination of U-Net and Siamese networks. The U-Net takes two input images and generates one, while the Siamese network distinguishes between the generated and the reference images. The proposed methodology achieves a mean correlation of 0.956 compared to reference images, showing its potential as a reliable medical tool to assist physicians in the detection of parathyroid glands. This advancement not only improves the accuracy of diagnosis, but also represents a significant step forward in integrating GAI into medical practice.

This type of analysis traditionally requires the collection, manual review, summary, and synthesis of an extensive literature base that requires hundreds of hours to complete. To increase both speed and efficiency, we utilized a reproducible workflow that incorporates multiple computational tools including generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to quickly summarize a large literature database. Our integrated approach coupled subject matter expertise with sorting and extraction algorithms to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the science for NAMs used for, or potentially useful for, the assessment of systemic toxicity of cosmetics. To identify potentially relevant studies, we conducted a literature search with keywords related to NAMs across three major topic areas: in silico, in chemico, and in vitro. We prioritized studies by coupling supervised clustering, topic extraction and keyword analysis algorithms. These methods led to the prioritization of 8,418 studies. To identify relevant studies, subject matter experts were employed in conjunction with active machine learning to identify relevant studies that were then summarized via GenAI. Given the objective was to provide sufficient coverage of the landscape to both address pragmatic, near-term needs, as well as shaping the future of how safety assessments are performed, we designed prompts to characterize the current and past systematic efforts directed towards developing and refining NAMs, including both success stories, scientific and technical challenges, and roadblocks to wider adoption. Our analysis identified 3,010 peer-reviewed publications and 38 consortium websites cataloguing NAMs that were applicable to the cosmetics regulatory process, from hazard-focused endpoints to exposure-based waiving of studies altogether. Additionally, they covered the full spectrum of maturity, from those approaches that show promise at the research and development phase to fully validated approaches ready for immediate regulatory use. To the extent available, we identified the molecular/cellular endpoints associated with each NAM and the reference dataset that was used to develop and/or evaluate usefulness and limitations across a total of 60,960 endpoints. The landscape also captured opportunities to validate mature NAMs to support their regulatory use and market adoption. These results will support the development and identification of NAMs to be included in frameworks for assessing systemic toxicity potential.",,0378-4274,411.0,,S64,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

It is thus no surprise that researchers have examined whether intensive use of ChatGPT can be considered an addictive behavior. At least four scales measuring ChatGPT addiction have been developed so far, all framed after substance use disorder criteria. Drawing parallels with previous cases of pathologizing everyday behaviors, we caution against labeling and defining intensive or habitual chatbot use as addictive behavior. To label a behavior as addictive, there must be convincing evidence of negative consequences, impaired control, psychological distress, and functional impairment. However, the existing research on problematic use of ChatGPT or other conversational AI bots fails to provide such robust scientific evidence.

These psychosocial phenomena are especially potent in mental health care, where outcomes are closely tied to patients’ expectations, perceived provider competence, and empathy. Drawing on conceptual understanding of placebo and nocebo effects and the latest research, this Viewpoint argues that GenAI may amplify these effects, both positive and negative. Through tone, assurance, and even the rapidity of responses, GenAI-generated text—either co-written with clinicians or peers, or fully automated—could influence patient perceptions in ways that mental health clinicians may not currently fully anticipate. When embedded in clinician notes or patient-facing summaries, AI language may strengthen expectancies that underlie placebo effects, or conversely, heighten nocebo effects through subtle cues, inaccuracies, or potentially via loss of human nuance.

However, methods for identifying players’ post-game experiences in the early stages have received far less attention than those for in-game experiences. In this study, we explored the potential of using measurements from wearable physiological sensors to predict players’ post–VR game experiences. The methods employed were correlation analyses and machine learning techniques. The results showed that electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements, particularly the mean EDA and mean EDA peak, are associated with players’ post-VR game experiences after accounting for noise. By utilizing machine learning technology, physiological metrics can forecast players’ diverse reactions after playing VR games with high accuracy. The symptoms of depersonalization/derealization experienced after VR gaming are attributed to being induced by actions within the virtual environment. This research makes significant contributions to the field of user experience recognition and the progression of VR gaming by demonstrating the potential for future VR game centers to analyze player emotions remotely and cost-effectively.

As GenAI systems increasingly act not merely as facilitators but as co-creators, they blur traditional boundaries between human and machine agency, raising critical questions about originality, authorship, and creative labor. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes 137 peer-reviewed articles (2023–2025) to map the evolving intersection of GenAI and human creativity, with a specific focus on implications for adaptive and personalized learning environments. Integrating Structural Topic Modeling (STM) with a meta-thematic synthesis, we identify twelve latent topics and five higher-order meta-themes: co-creation in design and aesthetics; GenAI-supported education and future skills; cognitive augmentation and creative reasoning; organizational knowledge work and market narratives; and ethical tensions surrounding copyright, bias, and representation. Our findings reveal that GenAI not only augments but transforms creativity, redistributing agency, reshaping evaluation criteria, and redefining the loci of value creation in socio-technical systems. These transformations carry significant implications for learner engagement, instructional design, and curriculum personalization. We advance five cross-cutting constructs including prompt literacy, distributed agency, ethical tensions, methodological gaps, and governance futures that collectively reframe creativity and learning in the GenAI era. The paper culminates in a conceptual framework and a future-oriented research agenda, offering theoretically generative and practically actionable insights for educators, designers, researchers, and policymakers seeking to harness GenAI for adaptive and personalized education.",Generative ai; Human creativity; Structural topic modeling; Co-creation; Prompt literacy; Distributed agency; Cognitive augmentation; Creative labor; Ai ethics; Information systems,3050-4759,2.0,4,100802,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

This study innovatively integrates chemical sensors with generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to construct a research paradigm for the intelligent design of lung cancer-specific receptors and the optimization of sensor interfaces. In terms of technological innovation, on one hand, an electrochemical sensing system based on nano-composite materials and an optical enhancement detection platform are built to achieve ultra-trace detection of lung cancer markers, aiming to break through the sensitivity bottleneck of traditional methods; on the other hand, multi-modal generative models are utilized to deeply mine multi-omics data, designing intelligent receptors with topological adaptability, significantly improving the accuracy and binding efficiency of biomolecule recognition. Clinical validation results show that this technology greatly enhances diagnostic efficacy in early lung cancer screening, and personalized treatment strategies based on AI effectively extend patient survival. In terms of technical translation and application, the developed portable detection devices and wearable monitoring technologies can reduce detection costs, providing a widely applicable screening solution for areas with limited medical resources.

Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions. The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offers a transformative approach. This study introduces a structured prompt optimization strategy, termed structured tag engineering prompt (STEP), to increase the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality tag files. To validate the STEP method, we assessed five mainstream LLMs on basic tag generation tasks via the CodeBERTScore and pass@k metrics. The results revealed that performance of all models has been improved, thus validating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. On the basis of these findings, a tag generation framework grounded in the STEP method was developed and validated through case studies and practical industrial scenarios. These validations confirmed the STEP method’s applicability, demonstrating its value and potential to advance prompt engineering for SCADA systems.

This phenomenon has complex social, legal, and ethical implications, particularly related to privacy violations, sexual exploitation, and legal vulnerabilities. This study aims to analyze the social impacts of deepfake pornography, identify existing legal gaps, and evaluate the ethical and regulatory responses that have emerged globally. Using the SLR approach, this study adopts the PICOS framework and PRISMA methodology in the screening and selection of scientific publications. The study finds that the majority of victims, especially women and vulnerable groups, experience psychological, social, and professional harm. Barriers to access to justice are exacerbated by weak legal frameworks, limited capacity of law enforcement officers, and gender bias in legal protection. The absence of a specific legal definition widens the scope for exploitation and exacerbates social inequality. The study recommends comprehensive legal reforms, including criminalization of non-consensual deepfake content, obligations for digital platforms in content moderation, and adoption of technologies such as watermarking (visible and invisible), C2PA standards-based metadata labelling, and advanced AI detection to track synthetic media.

This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2).

Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, WaveX (Ji et al., 2025a), comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic state refinement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic state refinement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management.

Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI’s capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban–rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width.

Yet, it remains unclear how best to assess and understand genAI's influence on our understanding of social reality. Building on insights into the representation of social worlds within texts, we introduce a framework for analyzing genAI's content and its consequences for perceptions of social reality. We demonstrate this “synthetic duality” framework in two parts. First, we show that genAI can create, with minimal guidance, reasonable portrayals of actors and ascribe relational meaning to those actors – virtual social worlds within texts, or “Mondo-Breigers”. Second, we examine how these synthetic documents with interior social worlds affect readers’ view of social reality. We find that they change individuals’ perceptions of actors depicted in the documents, likely by updating individuals’ expectations about the actors and their meanings. However, additional exploratory analyses suggest it is texts’ style, not their construction of “Mondo-Breigers”, that might be influencing people's perceptions. We end with a discussion of theoretical and methodological implications, including how genAI may unsettle structural notions of individuality. Namely, reimagining the duality of individuals and groups could help theorize growing homogeneity in an increasingly genAI-informed world.",Duality; Mondo-Breiger; Socio-semantic networks; Large language models; Generative artificial intelligence,0304-422X,108.0,,101966,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 Vision, capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. This paper derives a theoretical framework for integrating MLLMs into multimodal learning. This framework serves to explore the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering engagement in scientific practices, and providing assessments and feedback. These applications are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, thus increasing personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Despite the many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educators' roles, ensuring an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs for educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines.

However, criticisms of standardized testing, such as biases against underrepresented and low-income students, prompted a shift toward test-optional policies in many institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with a declining number of applicants, accelerated this trend and led numerous pharmacy schools to adopt PCAT-optional admissions policies, ultimately resulting in the examination’s official retirement in January 2024.

This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1).

The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks.

The transparency dilemma: How AI disclosure erodes trust,"Schilke, Oliver; Reimann, Martin",2025,2025/05/01/,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,10.1016/j.obhdp.2025.104405,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597825000172,"As generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into various work tasks, questions about whether its usage should be disclosed and the consequences of such disclosure have taken center stage in public and academic discourse on digital transparency. This article addresses this debate by asking: Does disclosing the usage of AI compromise trust in the user? We examine the impact of AI disclosure on trust across diverse tasks—from communications via analytics to artistry—and across individual actors such as supervisors, subordinates, professors, analysts, and creatives, as well as across organizational actors such as investment funds. Thirteen experiments consistently demonstrate that actors who disclose their AI usage are trusted less than those who do not. Drawing on micro-institutional theory, we argue that this reduction in trust can be explained by reduced perceptions of legitimacy, as shown across various experimental designs (Studies 6–8). Moreover, we demonstrate that this negative effect holds across different disclosure framings, above and beyond algorithm aversion, regardless of whether AI involvement is known, and regardless of whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, though it is comparatively weaker than the effect of third-party exposure (Studies 9–13). A within-paper meta-analysis suggests this trust penalty is attenuated but not eliminated among evaluators with favorable technology attitudes and perceptions of high AI accuracy. This article contributes to research on trust, AI, transparency, and legitimacy by showing that AI disclosure can harm social perceptions, emphasizing that transparency is not straightforwardly beneficial, and highlighting legitimacy’s central role in trust formation.",Trust; Disclosure; Generative artificial intelligence; Legitimacy,0749-5978,188.0,,104405,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p5_20250929_0703.ris

While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning.

Our study aimed to validate an AI-assisted critical appraisal (CA) tool by comparing it with human raters. We developed customized GPT models using ChatGPT-4. These models were tailored to evaluate studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) or the Jadad Scale in one model, while another model evaluated STROBE or CONSORT guidelines. Our results showed a moderate to good agreement between human CA and our GPTs for the NOS for cohort, case control and cross-sectional studies and for the Jadad scale, with an ICC of 0.68 [95 %CI: 0.24–0.82], 0.69 [95 %CI: 0.31–0.88], 0.76 [95 %CI: 0.47–0.90] and 0.84 [95 %CI: 0.57–0.94] respectively. There was also a moderate to substantial agreement between the two methods for STROBE in cross sectional, cohort, case control studies, and for CONSORT in trial design, with a K of 0.63 [95 %CI: 0.56–0.70], 0.57 [95 %CI: 0.47–0.66], 0.48 [95 %CI: 0.38–0.50] and 0.70 [95 %CI: 0.63–0.77] respectively. Our custom GPT models produced hallucinations in 6.5 % and 4.9 % of cases, respectively. Human raters took an average of 19.6 ± 4.3 min per article, whereas our customized GPTs took only 1.4.

VeracOS: An operating system extension for the veracity of files,"AlDuaij, Naser",2025,2025/10/01/,Computers & Security,10.1016/j.cose.2025.104565,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404825002548,"As generative artificial intelligence has improved, there is a growing trend of generating false media for spreading misinformation, driving propaganda, and theft through enhanced social engineering. This creates a global concern, leading to a heavy demand for verification and fact-checking of information. Existing solutions aim at educating users or using artificial intelligence to fact-check and detect false documents or media. While these methods provide a measure for combating misinformation, many of these existing methods are inaccurate. Methods such as deepfake detection for videos are an uphill battle as deepfake generation keeps improving and newer methods are created to subvert deepfake detection techniques. VeracOS is introduced and presented as an operating system modification that is easily deployed, can certify files that are created, and ensures that any user can automatically check the authenticity of files across any existing application or platform. VeracOS invents a unique algorithm for certifying and verifying files. VeracOS aims to revolutionize the war against misinformation and exploitation of fake content by introducing several key features: VeracOS allows users or corporations to easily and automatically certify their media. Unlike existing solutions, VeracOS avoids intensive computations, specialized hardware, and private data sharing. VeracOS also allows any user to automatically be notified if the file they are viewing is verified to be authentic. VeracOS does not require the modification of existing applications nor does it require the sharing of private information such as what files or media are being viewed by a user. These key features provide a highly portable and easily deployed system for users of any operating system, including Internet of Things devices and mobile operating systems. Using media files such as images and videos as exemplary file types and using Android as an exemplary operating system, a VeracOS prototype was implemented to allow any user to automatically certify or verify their media files. The results show that VeracOS is easy to use and can be easily run on smartphones without the need for specialized systems, applications, or hardware.",Mobile and ubiquitous computing; Operating systems; Systems security; Internet of Things; Other services and applications topics; File authentication; Generative artificial intelligence; Deepfake,0167-4048,157.0,,104565,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p6_20250929_0703.ris

This mixed-method study addresses this gap by exploring voice construction in GenAI-assisted photo essays from a dialogic perspective. In this study, we invited writing teachers to rank five student-produced photo essays according to their perceived voice strengths and analyzed the rankings using Kendall's Coefficient Concordance. The statistical analysis shows a weak agreement (W = 0.27) among raters, suggesting that voice is perceived quite diversely. The follow-up interviews with six focal raters reveal that they could agree on the importance of having unique ideas and angles in writing, keeping writing coherent and focused, using appropriate quotations, and incorporating images to enhance storytelling. However, opinions diverge regarding using primary and secondary texts, adopting academic discourse features, and including AI-generated images.

Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools.

Beyond embedding-mapping: Social network alignment via generative information fusion and LLM-guided iterative mechanism,"Gong, Jibing; Peng, Jiquan; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Wei; Li, Chaozhuo; Yu, Philip S.",2026,2026/03/01/,Information Fusion,10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103733,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625352500795X,"Social Network Alignment (SNA) aims to identify and match user accounts belonging to the same real-world individual across multiple social platforms, which has garnered growing research interest. Existing methods typically encode textual and structural information into a latent space and learn a mapping function from annotated user alignments to accomplish SNA. However, the inherent sparsity and noise in social data limit these models’ ability to fully capture user characteristics. Moreover, direct alignment based on latent space often overlooks critical details from the original information, reducing both alignment quality and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-SNA, a novel framework that integrates generative information fusion and LLM-guided iterative mechanism. The generative information fusion leverages LLMs to transform sparse user attributes, microblogs, and neighbor descriptions into enriched, comprehensive user profiles. We further perform intra-network and inter-network graph learning on enriched user profiles to incorporate structural information. To balance accuracy and efficiency, the LLM-guided iterative mechanism first applies a coarse filter based on embedding similarities to collect potential alignment candidates. The LLM then evaluates these candidates by reasoning over their original textual information. If the LLM deems the candidates misaligned, the candidate set is expanded until confident matches emerge. Comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the advantages of LLM-SNA over state-of-the-art baseline methods and highlight the potential of LLMs for SNA tasks.",Social network alignment; Large language model; Information fusion; Graph learning; Generative artificial intelligence,1566-2535,127.0,,103733,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p9_20250929_0703.ris

To resolve this issue, most enterprises are now transitioning to use Renewable Energy Sources (RES), and optimizing their power and energy usage, while holding the process efficient. To fully achieve this transition, a detailed power modeling of the robotic manufacturing system is crucial and, therefore, it is important to investigate this power modeling of the robotic manipulators’ consumption in a Smart Sustainable Manufacturing (SSM) to achieve the best power modeling results and better integrability analytics in optimal power planning of the robotic systems power supply. To this end, this paper presents a deep Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based modeling of robotic manipulators’ power supply interaction with the power grid, and RES. In the proposed system, which is powered by solar energy and the power grid, a SSM equipped with ten 6-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic manipulators is considered in the presence of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). Subsequently, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is employed to generate synthetic data for the system alongside the real data, thereby expanding the analytical horizons across varying operational characteristics of the system. Following this, a Residual Networks (ResNet) is developed to comprehensively analyze and predictively model the power consumption of the manipulators and their interactions with the power supply resources. Finally, the proposed hybrid GAI modeling strategy is numerically evaluated across a broad spectrum of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (MSE= 10−4, MAE= 3.6×10−3, R2= 99.98%, MARE= 1.97×10−2, RMSPE= 8.83×10−2%, MSRE= 7.8×10−3, RMSRE= 8.84×10−2, MAPE= 1.97×10−2%, and Max Error= 2.04×10−2), where these metrics demonstrate superior performance in power modeling.

How lack of choice to opt-out of generative artificial intelligence in traditional search engines drives consumer switching intentions: The mechanism of empowerment,"Mukherjee, Pubali; Jain, Varsha",2026,2026/01/01/,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,10.1016/j.jretconser.2025.104506,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698925002851,"The growing integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in traditional search interfaces is transforming how consumers search for information online. When AI-generated summaries are at the forefront without allowing users to opt out, their search experience becomes less user-driven and more system-controlled. Yet, its impact on consumer switching intentions is underexplored. Grounded in consumer empowerment and psychological reactance theories, this mixed-method research investigates how the lack of a choice feature to opt out of AI integration drives consumer switching intentions. Analyzing real-world discussions on Reddit, followed by an experiment, our findings reveal that when users lack the choice to disable AI-generated content, they feel less empowered, more intrusive, and irritated, increasing their likelihood of switching. Our findings extend interface design literature by identifying “choice to opt out of AI feature” as a critical design element for GenAI interfaces. While previous research has primarily theorized consumer empowerment in AI-enabled interfaces by focusing on autonomy, power, and control, our findings advance this literature by empirically demonstrating consumer choice as a novel and critical antecedent of empowerment. Further, we contribute to psychological reactance theory by extending it to a permanent, system-level disruption and demonstrate that the scale and permanence of reactance drive switching intentions. We provide actionable recommendations for interface designers to incorporate a toggle switch into GenAI interfaces, enabling users to choose to disable AI features. It suggests that managers may use empowerment as a strategic differentiator of interfaces to prevent consumers from migrating to alternative interfaces.",Generative artificial intelligence; GenAI; Generative search experience; Search engine behavior; Consumer empowerment; Switching intentions,0969-6989,88.0,,104506,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p2_20250929_0702.ris

Improvement of an eye disease detection model by using the denoising diffusion implicit model,"Kuo, Ping-Huan; Du, Eirene; Huang, Chiou-Jye; Lan, Wei-Chuan; Chou, Shu-Hung; Yao, Ting-Chun; Peng, Chao-Chung",2026,2026/02/01/,Computational Biology and Chemistry,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2025.108677,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147692712500338X,"With rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI), the discussion about and applications of generative AI have increased substantially. Generative AI has extensive and valuable applications in many industrial and medical fields and is a possible solution for industries that struggle to collect large quantities of data. The present study evaluated the use of generative AI in eye disease prediction. Because retinal images are difficult to acquire, this study used a generative AI model [i.e., the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)] to conduct data augmentation, thereby improving the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed for eye disease detection. This study adopted the DDIM primarily for its high inference speed and ability to consistently generate high-quality samples in a limited number of steps, making it suitable for tasks that require high-quality medical images. With the increasing prevalence of electronic products, the number of patients with retinopathy or optic neuropathy is increasing annually, and patients are experiencing these diseases at increasingly younger ages. Moreover, eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration are becoming increasingly common in modern society. The developed CNN model exhibited a 3 % higher accuracy when it was trained using the data generated by the DDIM than when it was trained without these data. This CNN model can screen eye disease symptoms early to enable patients to receive timely treatment, thereby mitigating the risk and consequences of eye diseases. The results of this study indicate that the training data generated using the DDIM can enhance the accuracy of early eye disease detection.",Eye disease detection; Generative artificial intelligence; Image classification; Denoising diffusion implicit model; Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling,1476-9271,120.0,,108677,,science_direct,/home/ycmejia/Escritorio/PROYECTO ALGORITMOS/bases_de_datos/science_direct/sd_generative-artificial-intelligence_p8_20250929_0703.ris

The objective is to enhance the predictive accuracy of market behavior through improved understanding of investor sentiment. The proposed sentiment analysis framework leverages six domain-specific datasets: Social Sentiment Indices (X-Scores), Fin-SoMe, SemEval-2017 Task 5, Fin-Lin, Sanders, and Taborda. These datasets, primarily sourced from social media, reflect diverse investor perspectives. Generative AI models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are used to create more data, and the meaning of words is enhanced using techniques like BERT and Word2Vec. The model is trained with a cross-entropy loss function and fine-tuned using Few-shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and ReAct strategies, ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score.

The results indicate that GenAI dependence promotes service innovation by decreasing affective rumination, and this beneficial indirect path is amplified by employees’ neuroticism.

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the “LLM-as-a-Judge” technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts’ evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the “LLM-as-a-Judge” technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds.
